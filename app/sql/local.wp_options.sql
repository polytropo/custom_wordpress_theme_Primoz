While this was a maintenance release fixing 46 bugs, it was significant for Core development because it made a point of highlighting Gutenberg — the new WordPress editor that is currently in development (more on that below).<br /></p>\n\n<p>This release also included some important updates to the privacy tools that were added to Core earlier this year.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Want to get involved in building WordPress Core?

Along with that, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/reference/faq/\">the Gutenberg Handbook</a> has some very useful information about how to use and develop for the new editor.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Want to get involved in building Gutenberg?

Over 2,000 people attended in person, with hundreds more watching live streams of the sessions.</p>\n\n<p>The WordCamp was a great success with plenty of first-time attendees and new WordPress contributors getting involved in the project and community. Recorded sessions from the 65 speakers at the event will be available on WordPress.tv in the coming weeks. In the meantime, check out the <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/wceu/albums\">photos from the event</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://2018.europe.wordcamp.org/2018/06/16/wordcamp-europe-2019/\">The next WordCamp Europe</a> takes place on June 20-22 2019 in Berlin, Germany. If you’re based in Europe and would like to serve on the organizing team, <a href=\"https://2019.europe.wordcamp.org/2018/06/16/call-wordcamp-europe-2019-organizers/\">fill in the application form</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Updated Roadmap for the New WordPress Content Editor</h2>\n\n<p>During his keynote session at WordCamp Europe, Matt Mullenweg presented <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/mullenweg-on-gutenberg-roll-out-plan/\">an updated roadmap</a> for <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/\">Gutenberg</a>, the new content editor coming in WordPress 5.0.</p>\n\n<p>While the editor is in rapid development, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/06/21/whats-new-in-gutenberg-21st-june/\">with v3.1 being released this past month</a>, the team is aiming to ship Gutenberg with WordPress Core in August, 2018. This is not set in stone — the release date may shift as development progresses — but this gives the first realistic idea of when we can expect the editor to be released.</p>\n\n<p>If you would like to contribute to Gutenberg, read <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/\">the handbook</a>, follow the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Core team blog</a>, and join the #core-editor channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>WordCamp Incubator Cities Announced</h2>\n\n<p>The WordCamp Incubator program helps spread WordPress to underserved communities by providing organizing support for their first WordCamp. The first iteration of this program ran successfully in 2016 and empowered three cities to start their own WordPress communities.</p>\n\n<p>This year, the Community Team is running the Incubator program again. After receiving applications from 104 communities, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/06/26/wordcamp-incubator-program-2018-locations-announcement/\">they have selected</a> Montevideo, Uruguay and Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia to participate in the program. Both cities will receive direct help from experienced WordCamp organizers to run their first-ever WordCamp as a way to help their WordPress community get started.</p>\n\n<p>To find out more about the Incubator program follow the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/\">Community team blog</a>, and join the #community-events channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n<h2>Further Reading:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>The WordPress community of Spain recently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wp_es/status/1004681694660603904\">received an award</a> for being the best open-source community in the country.</li>\n	<li>This month, WordPress reached <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all\">the milestone of powering 31% of websites</a>.</li>\n	<li><a href=\"https://wprig.io/introducing-wprig-wordpress/\">WP Rig</a> is a brand new tool to help WordPress developers build better themes.</li>\n	<li><a href=\"https://richtabor.com/gutenberg-block-unit-test/\">Block Unit Test</a> is a new plugin to help theme developers prepare for Gutenberg.</li>\n	<li>Near the end of the month, Zac Gordon hosted <a href=\"https://javascriptforwp.com/conference/\">an online conference</a> focused on JavaScript development in WordPress &#8211; the session videos will be available on YouTube soon.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>If you have a story we should consider including in the next “Month in WordPress” post, please <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/\">submit it here</a>.</em></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"6087\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"\n		\n		\n				\n		\n				\n\n		\n				\n								\n										\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"The Month in WordPress: May 2018\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/06/the-month-in-wordpress-may-2018/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 01 Jun 2018 09:09:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Month in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6065\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:360:\"This month saw two significant milestones in the WordPress community — the 15th anniversary of the project, and GDPR-related privacy tools coming to WordPress Core.

This is a noteworthy occasion for an open-source project like WordPress and one well worth celebrating. To mark the occasion, <a href=\"https://wp15.wordpress.net/\">WordPress communities across the world gathered</a> for parties and meetups in honor of the milestone.</p>\n\n<p>Altogether, there were 224 events globally, with <a href=\"https://wp15.wordpress.net/about/\">a few more of those still scheduled</a> to take place in some communities — attend one in your area if you can.</p>\n\n<p>If your city doesn’t have a WordPress meetup group, this is a great opportunity to start one! Learn how with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/welcome/\">the Meetup Organizer Handbook</a>, and join the #community-events channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Privacy Tools added to WordPress core</h2>\n\n<p>In light of recent changes to data privacy regulations in the EU, WordPress Core shipped important updates <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/05/wordpress-4-9-6-privacy-and-maintenance-release/\">in the v4.9.6 release</a>, giving site owners tools to help them comply with the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It is worth noting, however, that WordPress cannot ensure you are compliant — this is still a site owner’s responsibility.</p>\n\n<p>The new privacy tools include a number of features focused on providing privacy and personal data management to all site users — asking commenters for explicit consent to store their details in a cookie, providing site owners with an easy way to publish a Privacy Policy, and providing data export and erasure tools to all site users that can be extended by plugins to allow the handling of data that they introduce.</p>\n\n<p>To find out more about these features and the other updates, read the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/05/17/4-9-6-update-guide/\">4.9.6 update guide</a>. You can also get involved in contributing to this part of WordPress Core by jumping into the #core-privacy channel in the<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\"> Making WordPress Slack group</a>, and following<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\"> the Core team blog</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Updates to the WordPress.org Privacy Policy</h2>\n\n<p>In a similar vein, WordPress.org itself has received <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/privacy/\">an updated Privacy Policy</a> to make clear what is being tracked and how your data is handled. Along with that, a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/privacy/cookies/\">Cookie Policy</a> has also been added to explain just what is collected and stored in your browser when using the site.</p>\n\n<p>These policies cover all sites on the WordPress.org network — including WordPress.org, WordPress.net, WordCamp.org, BuddyPress.org, bbPress.org, and other related domains and subdomains. It’s important to note that this does not mean that anything has changed in terms of data storage; rather that these documents clarify what data is stored and how it is handled.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n<h2>Further Reading:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>WordCamp US 2018 has <a href=\"https://2018.us.wordcamp.org/2018/05/29/speak-at-wordcamp-us/\">opened up speaker submissions</a> for the December event.</li>\n	<li><a href=\"https://2018.europe.wordcamp.org/2018/05/15/wceu-live-stream-tickets/\">Live stream tickets are now available for WordCamp Europe</a>, happening on June 14-16.</li>\n	<li>Gutenberg, the new editor for WordPress Core, is getting ever closer to the final stages with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/05/18/whats-new-in-gutenberg-18th-may/\">a major update</a> this month.</li>\n	<li>In preparation for Gutenberg, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/43309\">significant work has been done</a> to improve WordPress Core’s build process.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>If you have a story we should consider including in the next “Month in WordPress” post, please <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/\">submit it here</a>.</em></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"6065\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"\n		\n		\n				\n		\n				\n		\n\n		\n				\n								\n										\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"WordPress.org Privacy Policy Updates\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/05/wordpress-org-privacy-policy-updates/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 25 May 2018 08:06:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"General\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"privacy\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6047\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:325:\"The WordPress.org privacy policy has been updated, hurray!

Bootsman, a WordPress consultant and WordCamp organizer, is walking to raise funds and awareness for the <a href=\"https://donatewc.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">DonateWC</a> organization.</p>\n<p>The DonateWC initiative provides a global fund for helping people in need of financial assistance to attend a big WordCamp. Donations go towards individually-tailored sponsorships that help selected attendees purchase a WordCamp ticket, door-to-door transportation, food and drink, and internet access.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Imagine for a moment that you are not backed by a company that will pay for you to go to a community event,&#8221; DonateWC founder Ines van Essen said. &#8220;You work hard at being a valuable community member but are never able to actually meet the others in your team. This means you are less likely to get a job, less likely to get recognized as a worthwhile member, you’re unlikely to be at the front-end of changes that impact your work significantly.&#8221;</p>\n<p>DonateWC aims to keep the larger WordCamps from being unintentionally exclusive of those with lesser financial means. Bootsman said he believes in the organization because it is community-driven and enables the greater WordPress community to do something for their fellow community members.</p>\n<p>So far, Bootsman&#8217;s walking journey has raised €116.57. He set up a <a href=\"https://walktowc.eu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">walktowc.eu</a> website to track his progress and the <a href=\"https://walktowc.eu/donate/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">donation page</a> displays a live update of donated funds. Contributors have the option to designate their donations for DonateWC or for Bootsman&#8217;s personal needs on the trek. He plans to deliver all of the funds raised for the organization when he arrives in Berlin. In the coming weeks he will also open up sponsor packages to better motivate companies to donate.</p>\n<p>Bootsman does not plan to work during his trek. He will be on the road for approximately 30 days and plans to walk 30km per day. He is traveling light with just a backpack and is looking for places where he can sleep along the way.

The theme has a simple, timeless design that appeals to both bloggers and business owners alike. It is active on more than 30,000 websites and some of those site administrators are using Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>What does Gutenberg support look like for Hemingway? Norén styled the editor to match the front-end design, with the same colors and fonts. He also added support for specific Gutenberg blocks, such as cover images, full-width elements, and pull quotes.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/hemingway-gutenberg-e1536683158337.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>image credit: Anders Norén\n<p>Norén said he knew since Gutenberg was announced that he would need to add support to all 17 of his themes in a substantial update at some point but had put it off because developing for the new editor felt &#8220;like aiming for a moving target.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don’t think it was any single thing that made me realize that I needed to get going with Gutenberg, but rather that the Gutenberg volume knob in the community has been turned up at a steady pace,&#8221; Norén said. &#8220;After the &#8216;Try Gutenberg&#8217; prompt in 4.9.8, I also started to receive a lot more support requests regarding Gutenberg. When regular WordPress users – not developers – started to ask when they can expect Gutenberg support in my themes, I knew that I couldn’t push it ahead of me much further.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Hemingway is the first of his themes to support the new editor and Norén is aiming to have his entire collection Gutenberg-ready by the time WordPress 5.0 is released. (This does not include the <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/theme/hemingway-rewritten\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hemingway Rewritten</a> version, which was created by Automattic and is available on WordPress.com.)</p>\n<p>Norén sees the new editor as a significant improvement over the current editor and said he thinks it is the right way forward for WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s always easy to speculate about the road not travelled, but the Visual Editor needs replacement, and Gutenberg will be a good replacement for it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It’s better at everything the old editor can do (except editing raw HTML, perhaps), and it also brings with it new possibilities for WordPress developers and users. There are a lot of issues in Gutenberg still to be worked out, but when they are, I think Gutenberg will be a big step forward for the WordPress community.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Norén said his chief concern is not about the editor itself but about how WordPress will handle the transition period for users, especially for those who would benefit from continuing on with the Classic Editor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I hope that the upgrade notice for 5.0 will be accompanied by clear messaging around the changes included in 5.0, along with the option to install the Classic Editor in Gutenberg&#8217;s stead,&#8221; Norén said. &#8220;Similar to the &#8216;Try Gutenberg&#8217; prompt, but presented more clearly as an either-or option before the user actually updates to 5.0. It was encouraging to see Matt Mullenweg say that the Classic Editor will be maintained for many years to come.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Norén&#8217;s 17 free WordPress.org-hosted themes have an estimated 100,000 active installs. Those using his products can be confident that the author behind the themes has Gutenberg-support among his immediate priorities for updates. Users who opt to move forward using the Classic Editor should not notice a difference in how the themes work.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I hope that Gutenberg is received with excitement and widespread support when 5.0 is finally released,&#8221; Noren said. &#8220;I also hope that the WordPress team does whatever it can to make sure that end-users don’t feel ambushed by the new editing experience.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 11 Sep 2018 18:04:17 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"WPTavern: Meetup Group Organizers Can Now Earn A WordPress.org User Profile Badge\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=83806\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"https://wptavern.com/meetup-group-organizers-can-now-earn-a-wordpress-org-user-profile-badge\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2241:\"<p>The WordPress Community team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/09/10/new-tool-for-community-deputies-meetup-tracker/\">has unveiled</a> a new tool called Meetup Tracker.

The local community organized its first meetup in 2011 with 40 participants. Since that time the community has grown and recently hosted 250 members for <a href=\"http://wp.tecnepal.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a two-day meetup</a> in January 2018.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordPress Biratnagar has a remarkably large number of enthusiastic participants in local WordPress meetups, more than any other meetups in Nepal,&#8221; lead organizer Ganga Kafle said. Kafle is a developer and WordPress.org theme reviewer. He said his local community is full of energetic youth who are excited to make the WordCamp happen.</p>\n<p>&#8220;From an 8th grade student in a government school to a 56-year-old passionate retired army soldier, all are members of the WordPress Biratnagar community. This community is diverse, open, and has the ability to have fun together. They help each other out a lot, sharing tips and tricks, and solve problems together.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Kafle said the topics of most interest to the local community include WordPress SEO, blogging, and WordPress theme development, as the majority of community members are students, developers, freelancers, and designers. He expects the WordCamp will attract attendees from different cities inside Nepal and from nearby countries, including India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and other South Asian countries. Sessions will be conducted in both English and Nepali.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Biratnagar will be the seventh WordCamp held in Nepal, following WordCamp Pokhara which is scheduled one month earlier on November 24. Pokhara is 11 hours away by car so the two WordPress communities are quite a distance away from each other. WordCamp Biratnagar is the last camp on the global WordCamp calendar for 2018.</p>\n<p>Kafle said he hopes the event will bring the Biratnagar WordPress community opportunities that will lead to more entrepreneurship and contribution to the greater tech community in the region. The event has <a href=\"https://2018.biratnagar.wordcamp.org/wordcamp-biratnagar-tickets/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">200 tickets available</a> and the capacity to expand if there is a greater demand.

The plugin is actively installed on more than 1K sites. Dark Mode replaces the white and grey colors in the backend with darker colors that are easier on the eyes.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img />Dark Mode for WordPress</div>\n\n<p>James has published <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/08/30/merge-proposal-dark-mode/\">a proposal</a> to merge the plugin into core. There are three things to know about Dark Mode up front. It does not have a high contrast mode to meet accessibility needs, is not a new admin color scheme for the backend, and is not a tool that helps people with vision issues. </p>\n\n<p>By default, WordPress ships with eight admin color schemes. However, color schemes are only applied to the WordPress sidebar and Admin toolbar. Dark Mode is applied to the main content area of the dashboard. This gives users the ability to use Dark Mode and an Admin Color Scheme in tandem. </p>\n\n<img />Admin Color Schemes\n\n<p>Dark Mode is not compatible with Gutenberg but is compatible with TinyMCE. Because of the speed at which Gutenberg is being developed as a plugin, James decided that a merge proposal without Gutenberg support is the best way forward. Compatibility with Gutenberg will likely arrive once it is merged into core.</p>\n\n<p>Because Dark Mode affects the content area of the WordPress Dashboard, if it&#8217;s merged into core, plugins will need to support two different color schemes. </p>\n\n<p>There is no easy way for Dark Mode to support every plugin, especially when many of them use custom user interface elements. <a href=\"https://github.com/danieltj27/Dark-Mode/wiki/Help:-Plugin-Compatibility-Guide\">This guide</a> on the <a href=\"https://github.com/danieltj27/Dark-Mode\">plugin&#8217;s GitHub page</a> explains how developers can add support for Dark Mode.</p>\n\n<h2>Proposal Hits a Snag</h2>\n\n<p>Within the comments on the proposal, members of the core and accessibility teams weighed in. Gary Pendergast, a WordPress core developer, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/08/30/merge-proposal-dark-mode/#comment-33913\">outlined</a> a list of requirements from the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/about/release-cycle/features-as-plugins/#feature-plugin-merge-criteria\">Core Handbook</a> that the plugin has yet to achieve. </p>\n\n<p>James <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/08/30/merge-proposal-dark-mode/#comment-33928\">responded</a> by explaining the process of merging a feature plugin into core as outlined in the Core Handbook does not lend itself to all projects. </p>\n\n<p>&#8220;For example, weekly meetings, or kick-off posts etc,&#8221; James said. &#8220;I understand that Gutenberg is probably a top priority right now but it’d be great if I could have some help on what to do to push this forward. I think an introduction of Gutenberg <strong>and</strong> Dark Mode would be a great addition to shout about in 5.0.&#8221;</p>\n\n<h2>Some of the Benefits of Dark Mode</h2>\n\n<p>One of the obvious benefits is that Dark Mode is aesthetically pleasing, especially after sunset. Depending on the <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Does-a-white-background-use-more-energy-on-an-LCD-than-if-it-was-set-to-black\">screen technology</a>, darker colors are more energy efficient. It&#8217;s also a mode that&#8217;s gaining in popularity. For example, earlier this year, <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/210/\">Apple announced</a> Dark Mode will be available in macOS Mojave.<br /></p>\n\n<p>I find myself using Dark Mode on Reddit, the Twitter app on my iPhone, and now WordPress. I like to browse the web on my phone while laying in bed and my partner enjoys not seeing a bright screen shining in her direction.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Based on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/08/30/merge-proposal-dark-mode/#comment-33929\">comments made</a> to the proposal and on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikelikethebike/status/1035513986836570112\">social media</a>, there is a definitive interest in having a Dark Mode option in WordPress. Is Dark Mode something you&#8217;d like to see be part of core? Also, I&#8217;m curious as to which Admin Color scheme you use.

Gutenberg&#8217;s handling of meta boxes has greatly evolved since that time and the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-gutenberg-products-block/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WooCommerce Gutenberg Products Block</a> feature plugin is now active on more than 20,000 sites.

The product is a natural extension of their current offerings, which include a page builder plugin used on more than 10,000 websites and a Storefront Pro plugin used on 5,000+ stores.</p>\n<p>Marsland said he was previously a skeptic about Gutenberg but is convinced that a unified interface is going to be the chief benefit of Gutenberg in the long term.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My skepticism was really based on how it was being rolled out to the WP community, rather than the technical approach of Gutenberg,&#8221; Marsland said. &#8220;I still feel that way actually. But from a end user point of view I’m convinced users are going to love it. 50% of our business is focused on running WordPress training courses for beginners, so we see first hand the issues that WordPress users have with the existing editor. The layout limitations of the current editor is the number complaint that users have with WordPress (from our experience of having trained thousands of end users over the past 7 years).&#8221;</p>\n<p>Marsland&#8217;s team at Pootlepress has gone all-in on developing for Gutenberg. So far their greatest challenge in extending the new editor has been keeping pace with its rapid development.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It feels a bit like developing for a moving target at times,&#8221; Marsland said. &#8220;The Gutenberg documentation is getting better but there are still gaps in it. The Slack channel has been really helpful though and the team have been great and responding to specific questions we have.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Marsland doesn&#8217;t see Gutenberg impacting Pootlepress&#8217; WooCommerce page builder product, at least not until Gutenberg evolves further on its journey into site customization capabilities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;At the moment Gutenberg is quite limited in what’s possible from a layout and design perspective,&#8221; Marsland said. &#8220;For example, our WooCommerce page builder plugin lets users change the design and layout of individual WooCommerce products. This isn’t possible with Gutenberg and may not be for quite some time. It feels like Gutenberg will stay more of a content editor than become a true page builder, especially given the current feedback from the community. That said, the ease of adding blocks within a unified interface like Gutenberg is perfect for a block approach like we are building for Storefront Blocks.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve been wondering what Gutenberg will look like in a WooCommerce context, Pootlepress&#8217; upcoming Storefront Blocks plugin gives you an idea of the customization possibilities the new editor will bring. The plugin makes it easy for non-technical store owners to showcase their products in a compelling way and enables them to create and customize product layouts. Storefront Blocks is an impressive example of how Gutenberg-powered products can replace clunky shortcodes with a more user-friendly interface for building store pages.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 05 Sep 2018 21:27:02 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"HeroPress: The Deaf World May Await, But It’s Not Silent\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2616\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:160:\"https://heropress.com/essays/the-deaf-world-may-await-but-its-not-silent/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-deaf-world-may-await-but-its-not-silent\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15627:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/090518-min-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: The handicap of deafness is no in the ear, it is in the mind. -- Marlee Matlin\" /><p>Have you ever wondered what it would be like if the world you lived in completely changed, turning your life upside down?</p>\n<p>And for those who have gone through an experience like this, can you remember how it felt to wake up in a world you were not used to?</p>\n<p>Even though life can throw many curve balls your way, the way you tackle them can redefine you as a person.</p>\n<h3>From One World to Another</h3>\n<p>I was just a toddler when I was diagnosed with a hearing impairment. My parents noticed my speaking skills lagged behind other toddlers of a similar age. I was diagnosed with a hearing loss at the age of 2 or 3.</p>\n<p>Even though it’s something I’ve lived with my entire life, it has been (and still is) a long and confusing journey for me as I try to figure out how best to live with it.</p>\n<p>You see, I’m not profoundly deaf. I can hear relatively well for now (I’ll get to that part in a minute), which means that I was brought up in a mainstream hearing environment.</p>\n<p>This didn’t come without its challenges though as I experience inaccessibility issues regularly. For example, noisy environments such as bars and restaurants, bad audio at conferences and mumbling voices when listening to podcasts.</p>\n<p>As a young child who didn’t know any better and acted naive about life, I just accepted it. But then as I got older and learned more about the world around me, well, that’s when things started to change.</p>\n<p>Because I am part of the hearing world but also have one “ear” in the non-hearing world, it has been a confusing position to be in. I already know what it’s “supposed to” be like if I had normal hearing. But that’s the thing, I don’t have normal hearing and I’m not profoundly deaf either.</p>\n<p>So where do I stand?</p>\n<p>Well there was always the possibility that my hearing would get worse, which was something my audiologist told me as a teenager. I figured maybe that will give me a better idea of where I stand.</p>\n<blockquote><p>But come on, as a teenager, I acted like a teenager – I was in denial about my situation and just wanted to fit in, like we all do as human beings.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Nothing was going to stop me from playing football, playing the guitar, socialising with friends, going to restaurants (plenty of head nodding happens there) and going to the cinema (even if I had to pretend to enjoy the latter and act as if I could hear everything, which was awkward when everyone talks about it afterwards).</p>\n<p>Over time, I learned to develop tricks to help me get by, living in both worlds. For example, when playing the guitar, I’m not able to fine-tune my music without the help of technology or someone else who can assist me. Or when I go to the cinema, I only focus on action movies so I don’t REALLY have to talk about the story line, so I talk about the graphics, car chases and explosions instead.</p>\n<p>On top of that I was learning English, which is my second language (but now my main language), and I was having speech therapy sessions and attended countless audiology appointments.</p>\n<p>But you keep going, right? You don’t let anything stop you. I made it through two universities, a number of jobs and navigated life in general throughout my twenties relatively unscathed.</p>\n<p>Then one day, a few years ago, I realised my hearing had declined even further. Unexpectedly, I found myself in a much quieter world than the one I was used to.</p>\n<p>Remember that warning from the audiologist? Well things got very real, very fast.</p>\n<p>I realised there was no turning back. And so began a whole new unfamiliar journey over what to do next.</p>\n<h3>Silent with a Loud Voice</h3>\n<p>It’s quite common to see online creators documenting their lives using whatever platform is available, such as social media and personal websites. The same applies for those who are going through certain struggles and share them with the world. And I used to find that strange. For something so personal, why would you share this with strangers?</p>\n<p>Many years ago, it’s not something that I would have thought of doing. And there was definitely no intention of writing about being partially deaf. Like I said, I was trying to fit in, so I told myself to keep going to the cinema and pretend that I enjoyed it.</p>\n<p>But there comes a time where you have to stop pretending and start being real, like I did by creating a video to publicly declare my intention to do so (and I’ll talk more about that later).</p>\n<p>I’m lucky to have a job that revolves around the internet. As someone who works in the digital marketing industry, it was natural for me to <a href=\"https://iamahmedkhalifa.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">have my own website</a>. I remember there were a lot of experimenting and trying to work out how to start one, as well as trying to figure out what it should be about.</p>\n<p>Having your own website sounds like a cool thing to have, but it wasn’t something I made a lot of use of in the early days. My priority was always on my clients’ or employers’ websites.</p>\n<p>But over the past few years, I’ve grown more and more involved with WordPress and have a deeper appreciation for those who use the platform to find their voice.</p>\n<p>And that made me curious.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It wasn’t until I started my own business in 2016 that I took WordPress more seriously, both for me personally and for my clients.</p></blockquote>\n<p>That is when I started to get more involved with the WordPress community. Because of my continued desire to contribute to the community and also how much I enjoyed helping others to make the most out of their WordPress sites. This inevitably led me to being one of the co-organisers of the WordPress meet-up group in Edinburgh as well as the current lead organiser for WordCamp Edinburgh.</p>\n<p>My main WordPress site is my business site. It’s where I predominantly focus on the subjects of SEO, Google Analytics, WordPress (of course), online business, etc. You know, anything to help others use their WordPress site to grow their online visibility, engagement and conversion.</p>\n<p>There is another side to being part of WordPress, and that is the community – it means you’re involved with a wide variety of people, mixing with different personalities and opening your mind to more experiences. It is where you can share valuable insights that can impact not just your life but the lives of those around you who are using WordPress in some shape or form.</p>\n<p>And that includes the subjects of inclusivity and accessibility, two areas which have a direct effect on me. But with regards to accessibility, I do depend on subtitles/closed captions in certain situations. I’m thankful that TV is getting better at it, but outside the house, it’s not that simple.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Having been to many meet-ups and WordCamps, the code of conduct is clear – it’s about making the environment welcoming and comfortable for everyone.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The subject of online accessibility is becoming more important. Even though we are still behind in terms of understanding accessibility and making it a standard approach on websites, I’m starting to see people taking it more seriously, and rightly so.</p>\n<p>So I should feel comfortable about the online world, right? Well, not exactly. Accessibility is still trying to catch up online and offline for everyone, not just for deaf people. For example, there are still campaigns going on to have subtitled screenings at cinemas as they tend to be limited and are often used during impossible hours like Monday mornings.</p>\n<p>Because apparently, deaf people don’t have day jobs.</p>\n<p>The combined effect of a lack of accessibility and various challenges means there is a nagging feeling that being deaf means my abilities are limited in an online world.</p>\n<p>It’s a stupid thing, right? But imposter syndrome is a powerful thing. If you don’t have a firm hold on it, it can be beat the hell out of you.</p>\n<p>Until one day&#8230;</p>\n<p>“Enough! I’ve had enough.”</p>\n<p>There came a point where I decided to let go of the very thing (my hearing impairment) that I felt was holding me back in life and to use that as the catalyst to move forward. I was reading a book called “Let Go” by Pat Flynn of Smart Passive Income. He is someone I’ve admired from afar and I have learnt a lot from him, even before reading that book.</p>\n<p>But that book was the first “soft” trigger for me in accepting the present and the future. Little did I realise how doing this would pave the way for a whole new world of possibilities and opportunities. And that’s when the second trigger happened. I had the opportunity of spending a day with Pat in San Diego – it was an experience I’ll never forget.</p>\n<p>But just as importantly and for the final trigger, it allowed me remove those chains that shackled me and gave me the freedom to move forward and to take advantage of whatever life had to offer me, even if it meant things were “limited” because of my gradual hearing loss.</p>\n<p>It’s amazing what can happen when you share your vulnerabilities and experiences with others. We can always learn from each other and sharing this experience has ended up helping many others. I have received private messages from strangers thanking me for creating videos that help spread awareness.</p>\n<p>And I’m not stopping there either.</p>\n<h3>The World Got Quieter</h3>\n<p>If I am going deeper into the deaf world, it doesn’t mean it’s going to be silent, at least not in an online sense. I have created a dedicated website called <a href=\"https://hearmeoutcc.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hear Me Out! [CC]</a> to document my hearing journey. It’s a place to share other people’s stories and to provide advice on managing in the deaf world – whether you are deaf or not.</p>\n<p>See, that’s the great thing about putting websites together. It’s about giving you the platform you never had before. It’s also the ethos of WordPress &#8220;to democratise publishing through Open Source, GPL Software”.</p>\n<p>It’s a funny thing when you start documenting and talking about your life online. Many people use social media as a platform to help with that and to create a voice, but I prefer to use my WordPress site for that voice. And then I use social media to help elevate it.</p>\n<h3>Your Voice Can Influence Others</h3>\n<p>Since I’ve been using WordPress and been involved in digital marketing for almost 10 years, it made sense to use that experience to my advantage. I’m lucky that my business allows me to use my expertise to help other people with their sites.</p>\n<p>But sometimes you have to be a little selfish and think about your own journey too, not just those of your clients or customers (as well as your friends and family).</p>\n<p>Not only are you allowed to do that, but you should do that. Because if you don’t help yourself first, you can’t help anyone else around you.</p>\n<p>Several years ago, I wouldn’t have thought of doing that. I mean, who the hell would want to listen to me? But I truly believe in the motto “your vibe attracts your tribe” – it doesn’t matter who you are, you’ve got something worth sharing online that your tribe, whoever they are, would love.</p>\n<p>And it’s never too late to start.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>There is a quote I really like by American actress, Marlee Matlin:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The handicap of deafness is not in the ear; it is in the mind.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>That quote applies to me perfectly, but you can also apply it to your own circumstances if deafness doesn’t apply to you.</p>\n<p>It’s like that old saying we all heard as children: “You can do anything if you put your mind to it.”</p>\n<p>It is kind of true in a way, but it has taken me a long time to realise it. Even though I wish I had started earlier, it’s about starting today rather than thinking about yesterday.</p>\n<p>And I think that can apply to any situation.</p>\n<p>I’m not just talking about creating a website. It’s also about finding the right time for you to let go of whatever is holding you back, and for you to understand what your next steps are.</p>\n<p>That was my challenge. I had to redefine myself if I wanted to move forward. I see no reason why you can’t do that too.</p>\n<p>So here is my message to you: if you have something that is holding you back, I urge you to write down what you are going to do about it. You need to stick it somewhere where you can see it all the time.</p>\n<p>And if you are feeling REALLY brave, you can let me know in the comment section below what is holding you back in your life – and what you are doing to let it go.</p>\n<p>My way of doing that was to create another WordPress site to share my stories and document my journey.</p>\n<p>Because take it from me, once you do that, the world awaits you… online and offline.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: The Deaf World May Await, But It&#8217;s Not Silent\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=The%20Deaf%20World%20May%20Await%2C%20But%20It%27s%20Not%20Silent&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fthe-deaf-world-may-await-but-its-not-silent%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: The Deaf World May Await, But It&#8217;s Not Silent\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fthe-deaf-world-may-await-but-its-not-silent%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fthe-deaf-world-may-await-but-its-not-silent%2F&title=The+Deaf+World+May+Await%2C+But+It%26%238217%3Bs+Not+Silent\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: The Deaf World May Await, But It&#8217;s Not Silent\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/the-deaf-world-may-await-but-its-not-silent/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/090518-min-150x150.jpg&description=The Deaf World May Await, But It\'s Not Silent\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: The Deaf World May Await, But It&#8217;s Not Silent\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/the-deaf-world-may-await-but-its-not-silent/\" title=\"The Deaf World May Await, But It&#8217;s Not Silent\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/the-deaf-world-may-await-but-its-not-silent/\">The Deaf World May Await, But It&#8217;s Not Silent</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 05 Sep 2018 08:00:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Ahmed Khalifa\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:108:\"WPTavern: AMP for WordPress Plugin to Introduce User-Friendly Theme Support Settings in Upcoming 1.0 Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=83671\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:119:\"https://wptavern.com/amp-for-wordpress-plugin-to-introduce-user-friendly-theme-support-settings-in-upcoming-1-0-release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14488:\"<p>In October, Google&#8217;s open source <a href=\"https://www.ampproject.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AMP project</a> (Accelerated Mobile Pages) will be heading into its third year. The initiative aims to improve performance on the mobile web and currently boasts usage on 25 million domains across publishing, advertising, e-commerce, and business websites.</p>\n<p>WordPress had a rocky beginning with its <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">official AMP plugin</a>, which was originally developed by Automattic, one of the earliest publishing partners on the project. The first versions of the plugin were not easy to use, especially for heavily customized installations. It required site owners to invest considerable effort into optimizing AMP pages and fine tuning them for their needs. AMP for WordPress <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/amp-project-turns-2-automattic-partners-with-google-to-improve-wordpress-plugin\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">went without updates for 10 months in 2017</a>, was fraught with errors, and incompatible with many other plugins.</p>\n<p>XWP began leading development of the plugin last year in partnership with Google, beginning with the 0.6 release. Weston Ruter is the tech lead with several XWP engineers contributing to development, design, and testing. Alberto Medina, Developer Advocate at Google, and his team have been leading the product management and outreach efforts.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Around May last year, my team at Google started a long-term effort with a bigger scope than just AMP, which included significantly investing engineering resources on the development of the plugin,&#8221; Medina said. &#8220;We started investing development resources, and then teamed up with XWP to expand the engineering scope. During this phase of the project Google and XWP have driven all the execution of the project and the development efforts.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ruter said his team went through six months of the plugin&#8217;s support topics on WordPress.org and categorized them to figure out what issues users were struggling with most. They used that information to guide the focus for their first release and have been keeping a pulse on the support forum ever since.</p>\n<p>The plugin has incorporated many changes since XWP began spearheading its development, putting AMP&#8217;s newer features to use within the context of WordPress. Earlier versions of the plugin only allowed posts to be served as AMP but the 0.6 release added pages to its capabilities. Version 0.7 introduced the ability for all URLS on a site to served as AMP (“Native AMP”) but lacked the ability for users to customize which types of content should be excluded from this format. The upcoming 1.0 release will allow users to have a native AMP site that excludes certain templates, such as a shopping cart or a category archive, from being served as AMP.</p>\n<p>&#8220;AMP initially was limited in functionality,&#8221; Ruter said. &#8220;The AMP plugin was created when AMP was young. In the beginning it was focused on Accelerated <em>Mobile</em> Pages and it wasn&#8217;t able to recreate full responsive experiences that site owners expect. This has changed and AMP is able to do a lot. So that is what we have been focused on with the AMP plugin, is to bring it up to speed with the AMP project itself so that WordPress sites can take advantage of all the features and functionality that are now available.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The team at XWP is aiming to release version 1.0 of AMP for WordPress in mid-September. The <a href=\"https://make.xwp.co/2018/06/09/amp-plugin-release-v1-0-alpha1/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1.0 alpha release</a> introduced extended AMP theme support with a more user-oriented approach to the settings. Previous versions of the plugin were more developer-centric, requiring edits to a theme or child theme to configure template support. Users can now enable Native AMP or Paired mode on the AMP settings screen and the <a href=\"https://make.xwp.co/2018/07/06/amp-plugin-release-v1-0-beta1/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">beta release</a> adds granular controls for selecting supported templates.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/amp-1-0-beta.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>image credit: <a href=\"https://make.xwp.co/2018/07/06/amp-plugin-release-v1-0-beta1/\">XWP</a>\n<p>Other notable updates in the alpha and beta releases include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhanced UI for handling AMP validation errors</li>\n<li>Expanded Gutenberg support to surface AMP validation errors at a block level</li>\n<li>Addition of AMP-specific functionality to core blocks</li>\n<li>Redirection to non-AMP URL when unaccepted validation errors present</li>\n<li>Beta brings back WP Admin Bar AMP menu with AMP error highlighting</li>\n</ul>\n<p>AMP for WordPress <a href=\"https://make.xwp.co/2018/08/06/amp-plugin-release-v1-0-beta2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">v1.0-beta2</a> was released in August and is not yet ready for production use. The good news for those who want to use AMP is that the plugin is becoming more of a plug-and-play solution as development progresses.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There is only one setting that the user needs to change to take advantage of the new theme support: switching from legacy to paired or native,&#8221; Ruter said. &#8220;Everything else is optional and just customizes the behavior. There will be a new admin pointer in 1.0 that will call out this updated admin screen.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ruter also said his team is considering implementing a wizard-type experience to minimize the number of tweaks users need to make. They are discussing automating the compatibility check of the various templates prior to enabling theme support so users can get a high level view of the areas of the site that would be best-suited for AMP.</p>\n<h3>AMP Remains a Controversial Solution to Web Page Performance</h3>\n<p>Many users encountered insurmountable difficulties in their first attempts at using the AMP plugin with highly customized sites, relegating AMP usage to sites with dedicated engineering teams. Early versions of the AMP project did not have the flexibility that many publishers required.</p>\n<p>Brian Boyer, VP of Product and People at Spirited Media, home of The Incline, Billy Penn, and Denverite publications, gave a presentation at WordCamp for Publishers titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2018/08/22/brian-boyer-why-we-ditched-amp-and-other-ux-choices-we-made-for-launching-membership/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Why we ditched AMP, and other UX choices we made for launching membership</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We need more control over our user experience than AMP allows &#8211; to build an unshitty, persuasive, native feeling, highly effective membership experience, I need a little more JavaScript,&#8221; Boyer said. &#8220;I need a little bit more control over the page and to be fair, we could probably make some of this stuff but we cannot afford to design, build, and most crucially, test multiple versions of our website.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Boyer cited the expense of of building and testing multiple codebases as one of the primary reasons his team ditched AMP. The complication of maintaining a second user experience was &#8220;far too much to ask&#8221; for his development team, who had already produced a fast, lightweight WordPress setup with proper caching.</p>\n<p>&#8220;An AMP page might load a little faster but our other needs far outweigh that minor performance improvement,&#8221; Boyer said. &#8220;We got over our FOMP (Fear of Missing Pageviews). If I can be better at making conversions, I&#8217;ll take the hit with pageviews.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Recent <a href=\"https://xwp.co/an-introduction-to-native-amp/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Enhancements to the AMP project and the plugin</a>, including the addition of components allowing for the creation of rich interactive experiences, continue to narrow the gap between the custom JavaScript many websites require and AMP&#8217;s limitations. This may be encouraging for those who have chosen to embrace AMP, but ultimately will not make a difference for those who fundamentally oppose the initiative as an affront to the open web.</p>\n<p>Beyond the technical investment in fine-tuning an AMP setup to meet the needs of his publications, Boyer concluded the presentation by outlining his broader objections to the AMP project:</p>\n<blockquote><p>By policing slow websites, Google has turned the big publishers&#8217; problem into my problem, but that fix comes at a high cost to me, a small publisher,&#8221; Boyer said. &#8220;AMP is not the Open Web &#8211; it&#8217;s a short term fix for bad choices. If you build a slow and terrible website that supports a creepy business model, like tracking the shit out of your users, then yes, AMP is one path to a better user experience. It is an escape hatch from your legacy code and the bad choices of your predecessors. I understand why that would be tempting, but it is also a deal with the devil. AMP and its cousin Instant Articles put even more control in the hands of companies that already have too much control, and I for one cannot abide by that. I just ask you, do the work, fix your websites, make them fast, friendly, and respectful.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Other vocal critics are not comfortable with how Google is positioning AMP as a long-term solution, instead of addressing the root issues of web page performance. Jeremy Keith articulated this stance in his article titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://adactio.com/journal/13964\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AMPstinction</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;If the AMP project existed in order to create a web where AMP was no longer needed, I think I could get behind it,&#8221; Keith said. &#8220;But the more it’s positioned as the only viable solution to solving performance, the more uncomfortable I am with it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Which, by the way, brings me to one of the most pernicious ideas around Google AMP—positioning anyone opposed to it as not caring about web performance. Nothing could be further from the truth. It’s precisely because performance on the web is so important that it deserves a long-term solution, co-created by all of us: not some commandants delivered to us from on-high by one organization, enforced by preferential treatment by that organization’s monopoly in search.&#8221;</p>\n<p>However, decoupling AMP from Google&#8217;s influence would also mean separating the project from the leadership and resources that have so far driven its adoption across millions of websites. There may be other approaches to addressing performance but Alberto Medina and his team see AMP as serving a practical purpose for users and developers who wouldn&#8217;t otherwise be capable of optimizing their sites to the same degree. What he described is in a sense &#8220;democratizing performance.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The root causes of web performance problems are well known and there are tools, techniques, and web APIs, that allow developers to achieve awesome UX close to what AMP provides,&#8221; Medina said. &#8220;However, the reality is that doing so is very hard for most developers. Usually achieving it requires having solid engineering teams and enough financial resources. That is not fair for most developers and organizations that do not have the resources.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Medina sees AMP as an answer to what he describes as the <a href=\"https://medinathoughts.com/2018/05/17/progressive-wordpress/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Capability/Usage gap</a>: the difference between what can be achieved in the web and what is actually done in the web.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The problem is that as the power and complexity of the web increases, that gap has increased as well,&#8221; Medina said. &#8220;The problem is that as long as that gap exists, achieving the best UX is not possible. So, the goal is to close that gap. There are two options: developers do the right thing all the time, or we provide tooling/libraries that enable them to do the right thing in an easy and effective way. AMP served the latter purpose.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Medina also emphasized that AMP is fully built on open web technologies. &#8220;Basically, it provides what developers could do by themselves but it is hard to do,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>In a recent <a href=\"https://art19.com/shows/recode-decode/episodes/3d56208e-a4b9-4c74-861e-8fec105a4ee8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Recode Decode podcast interview</a> with Kara Swisher, Matt Mullenweg also weighed in on the AMP project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It gets a bad rap because Google kind of botched the rollout a little bit,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;The underlying tech is open source and it&#8217;s actually quite good. Because for you as an independent publisher to have a future, we need you to load just as fast as something that&#8217;s embedded in an app. Facebook has done the bait and switch so many times that we need an independent alternative and I think AMP can be that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Google&#8217;s investment in the AMP plugin through its partnership with Automattic and XWP has made AMP more approachable for the average user, especially with the updates coming in version 1.0. Medina said Google chose to collaborate with WordPress because they share a similar goal of providing a better user experience for the platform.</p>\n<p>&#8220;AMP is not an end goal in itself; the real objective is enabling all WordPress developers and site owners to provide awesome user experiences powered by WordPress,&#8221; Medina said. &#8220;AMP is just a component in that overall story, together with PWA capabilities, coding and performance best practices, Tide, etc.&#8221; In architecting the latest version of the plugin, Medina said the team is aiming to &#8220;enable native AMP experiences in WordPress without compromising content fidelity or surrendering the flexibility of the WordPress platform.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Whatever your opinion of the AMP project, the user-friendly theme support options and better validation error handling are game changing improvements for the WordPress plugin. It is currently active on more than 300,000 sites. Updates coming in the 1.0 release will enable thousands of WordPress users to have a more successful experience with AMP.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 04 Sep 2018 21:28:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"Dev Blog: The Month in WordPress: August 2018\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6191\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/09/the-month-in-wordpress-august-2018/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5553:\"<p>Many of the WordPress contribution teams have been working hard on the new WordPress editor, and the tools, services, and documentation surrounding it.

These proposals are spread across several tickets on GitHub.</p>\n<p>Two weeks ago, Gutenberg technical lead Matias Ventura submitted a PR exploring the possibility of <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/8920\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">introducing a &#8220;Focus Mode&#8221; to the editor</a>. This mode would highlight the current selected block with all other blocks faded while the &#8220;fix toolbar to header&#8221; option is enabled. The video below shows an example of what that might look like:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>&#8220;The aim is to provide a writing experience that can satisfy those that would prefer an environment with the least amount of distractions at the expense of tool clarity,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been testing this and personally find it a very enjoyable mode to toggle when I just want to write for a bit. Paired with a robust set of keyboard shortcuts it could be quite nice to use. In this sense, it&#8217;d be important to provide an easy keyboard shortcut to toggle the mode on and off.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Automattic designer Kjell Reigstad opened another <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/9334\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ticket</a> that proposes transforming the &#8220;Fix Toolbar to Top&#8221; setting into a &#8220;Focus Mode.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;A key feedback point we hear is that Gutenberg’s interface can be a little overwhelming,&#8221; Reigstad said. &#8220;This often comes from users who more commonly focus on &#8216;writing&#8217; versus &#8216;building&#8217; their posts. They find the contextual block controls and block hover states to be distracting: When they&#8217;re focused on writing, they don&#8217;t necessarily want to think about blocks — they just want to write.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Reigstad said this same subset of users also misses having the formatting toolbar at the top of the page, as it is in other applications like Google Docs, MS Word, and WordPress&#8217; classic editor. He proposed a solution that addresses these concerns by combining the &#8220;Fix Toolbar to Top&#8221; option with the following UI changes that would provide a more complete &#8220;Focus Mode:&#8221;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The block toolbar would be pinned to the top of the screen.</li>\n<li>The editor would be full screen.</li>\n<li>Block outlines would be removed for both hover and selected states.</li>\n<li>The block label would appear on a delay, and be toned down visually.</li>\n<li>Block mover + block options would also appear on a delay.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reigstad also created a video demo of this concept:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This new &#8220;focus Mode&#8221; concept is also compatible with Ventura&#8217;s proposal for highlighting the current selected block and fading out the others. It could either be present in both modes or available as an add-on feature.</p>\n<p>A couple of well-written reviews on the Gutenberg plugin <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/not-everyone-needs-everything-to-be-blocks-gutenberg-must-focus-on-writers/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">describe how the concept of blocks complicates the writing experience</a> and how Gutenberg&#8217;s current writing environment is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/gutenberg-gets-wordpress-wrong-and-is-a-terrible-writing-environment/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">visually distracting and disruptive</a>. This has been a major concern since the plugin was first released for testing, as there are many users who depend on WordPress for its writing features more than the page building aspects.</p>\n<p>The Gutenberg team&#8217;s new ideas go a long way towards decluttering the interface for writers. This is especially important for those who want to do their long-form writing inside WordPress, instead of beginning their work in an application that is dedicated to providing a distraction-free writing experience. Introducing a &#8220;focus mode&#8221; or &#8220;writing mode&#8221; will solve one of the most critical issues with the new editor and we&#8217;re looking forward to seeing how this develops.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 29 Aug 2018 18:32:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"HeroPress: WordPress Is For You\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://heropress.com/?p=2610\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"https://heropress.com/wordpress-is-for-you/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-is-for-you\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3215:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/OpenUpDoors-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: This one simple attitude adjustment, changing “no” to “let me look into that”, opened up more doors and possibilities than I ever thought possible.\" /><p>When HeroPress started, a stated intention was to be a voice for people on the fringe of the Western WordPress culture.

Pendergast&#8217;s post is a breath of fresh air and something I&#8217;d like to see more often from other core contributors.<br /></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 29 Aug 2018 04:58:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"WPTavern: New WP Glossary Site Translates WordPress Techspeak into Plain English\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=83522\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:91:\"https://wptavern.com/new-wp-glossary-site-translates-wordpress-techspeak-into-plain-english\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3701:\"<p><a href=\"http://www.andersnoren.se/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Anders Norén</a> has launched a new website called <a href=\"https://www.wpglossary.net/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WP Glossary</a> that contains definitions for terms that people encounter when using WordPress. The resource was born out of a need to provide documentation for client projects.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The last time I updated the glossary for a new client documentation, in the middle of May this year, it hit me that there must be a website for this,&#8221; Norén said. &#8220;A list of WordPress definitions written not for WordPress developers, but for those who manage WordPress websites either as part of their work or in their spare time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Norén said he found resources written for developers but nothing satisfactory for regular WordPress users. Inspired to fill this gap, he bought a domain name and built the site over the next couple weeks. WP Glossary contains definitions for nearly a hundred WordPress-specific and industry-related terms, with more than 25,000 total words.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/wp-glossary.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>image credit: Anders Norén\n<p>Norén, who has recently jumped into client work with a new agency, is better known for his popular minimalist <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/author/anlino/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">themes on WordPress.org</a>. His 17 themes have a cumulative rating of 4.97 out of 5 stars and <a href=\"http://wptally.com/?wpusername=anlino\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">more than 2.1 million downloads</a>.

The terms also link to related documentation and some also have related WordPress.tv links. The <a href=\"https://www.wpglossary.net/word/default-themes/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Default Themes</a> term is the longest article on the site with 1,744 words.

As long as the toolbar is visible, so is the option to change block types. However, there are a few user experience issues with this approach.<br /></p>\n\n<img />Convert Block Option\n\n<p>The first is obvious. The paragraph block icon looks like an alignment option. The second issue is that the icon represents the current block being edited, sort of like a block label. Unless a user hovers their cursor over the icon, it&#8217;s difficult to realize that it&#8217;s for changing block types. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kevinwhoffman\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kevin Hoffman</a>, a WordPress developer and core contributor, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/9127#issuecomment-416058227\">has proposed</a> a new user interface suggestion that aims to solve the issues mentioned above. </p>\n\n<img />Suggested Changes by Kevin Hoffman\n\n<p>Hoffman suggests changing the icon to a drop-down menu, similar to the one in the Classic Editor. The menu would make the ability to change block types more discoverable. It removes confusion associated with icons and is a workflow that&#8217;s already established. </p>\n\n<p>Gutenberg developer Joen Asmussen <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/9127#issuecomment-416166190\">thanked Hoffman</a> for the feedback and listed a number of things to consider with his approach. These include the editor&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/7479#issuecomment-410988762\">need to be responsive</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/9075\">scale to editors</a> with thin columns, accessibility, and accommodating long block names. </p>\n\n<p>Gutenberg technical lead Matías Ventura <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/9127#issuecomment-416206202\">also commented</a> on the proposal.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Just wanted to say thanks for all the constructive voices here and willingness to find better solutions. If there&#8217;s anything that is fairly clear is that the current &#8216;block switching&#8217; interaction is not as obvious as it could be.</p><p>I think using the paragraph icon instead of the one that is easily confused as alignment, <a href=\"https://github.com/jasmussen\">@jasmussen</a>&#8216;s update in <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/9310\">#9310</a>, plus the addition of the drop-down arrow are a good baseline to check on the next release and see if we need something more involved. <a href=\"https://github.com/kevinwhoffman\">@kevinwhoffman</a> it&#8217;d be great to expand on your proposal and see how it might look across more blocks and nested contexts.</p><cite>Matías Ventura</cite></blockquote>\n\n<p>Depending on your workflow, changing block types will be a common action. For example, I often press enter at the end of a paragraph block which creates a new paragraph block automatically. Being able to easily identify and use the change block type option will improve my writing experience.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Those with feedback on Hoffman&#8217;s proposal are encouraged to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/9127\">respond to the issue</a> on GitHub.

Since its release, the community has speculated about what the plugin&#8217;s active installation numbers mean and how long it will be supported.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg has confirmed that support for the Classic Editor will be available for &#8220;many years to come,&#8221; which should come as a relief to those who feared that WordPress would drop support for the old editor after a year or two.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I love that people are using the Classic Editor plugin!&#8221; Mullenweg said in <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-and-classic-editor-plugins-pass-200000-active-installations-wordpress-4-9-9-planning-underway#comment-257369\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">comment</a> on a recent post. &#8220;There is an infinite number of ways that WP can be used and not all will be ready for Gutenberg when 5.0 is released, Classic allows people to still be able to update core and stay current with releases, and with the click of a button try out Gutenberg again in the future if they want to. It’s also trivial to maintain because Gutenberg also uses TinyMCE, so Classic Editor users will still get improvements and updates to TinyMCE — I won’t say &#8216;forever&#8217; but I don’t see any reason why we can’t maintain classic for the edit screen for many years to come.&#8221;</p>\n<p>These assurances about the continued availability of the classic editor mean that WordPress product developers will need to decide if they want to provide support for both editing experiences or go full steam ahead with Gutenberg, limiting support to WordPress 5.0+. We don&#8217;t yet know how many users will be installing the Classic Editor after WordPress 5.0 is released but that may inform more product decisions in the future.</p>\n<h3>The Market Will Drive Gutenberg Adoption</h3>\n<p>During the Q&amp;A following the State of the Word in 2017, WordPress developer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kevinwhoffman\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kevin Hoffman</a> asked a question about the prospect of developers having to support two different editing interfaces:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Hearing you suggest the Classic Editor plugin and different ways to undeclare support for Gutenberg leads me to this idea that we are headed towards a split admin interface with no finality to the transition, meaning that I don&#8217;t see a time in the future where everyone will be on Gutenberg. We will always have these people in classic mode. As plugin and theme developers, we will always have to support two different types of users. How do we reach that point where we are past the transition, however long it might take, where we can not have this box of chocolates effect where you click &#8220;edit post type&#8221; and you never know what you&#8217;re going to get?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mullenweg said his hope and expectation, based on how this has worked out with new interfaces in the past, is that over time product developers would adopt the latest interface. He cited the Customizer as one example where one is now very hard-pressed to find a theme developer who is rolling their own options panel after the Customizer was introduced as the new standard. It was just three years ago in 2015 when <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-now-requires-theme-authors-to-use-the-customizer-to-build-theme-options\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.org began requiring theme options to be built using the Customizer</a> and now it is used everywhere.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The truth is, if you are a plugin or theme developer, people are going to expect things in Gutenberg, so you really need to develop for Gutenberg,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;And then, at some point, I&#8217;m totally ok if you drop support for the Classic [Editor]. There will be themes and plugins that will say you need to have Gutenberg, [WP] 5.0 or newer if you want to use this.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We already have that existing now. Plugins only support so far back in PHP in WordPress. There will be plugins that don&#8217;t support under WordPress 5.0. It&#8217;s not going to be that much different from supporting different WordPress versions where people choose sometimes to go way way way back, sometimes a year or several years, and support WordPress 3.8 and 3.9. And some don&#8217;t bother anymore. There&#8217;s lots of APIs and other things that changed during that time. At some point you just have to make a cost benefit analysis and do things like maybe Yoast is doing for upgrading PHP, and say, &#8216;Hey, if you really want the best of this, check out this new thing.\'&#8221;</p>\n<p>As Gutenberg blocks become the standard way of extending WordPress&#8217; editing and customization capabilities, the market will drive its adoption. This is already happening with new blocks and block collections being released every day. The new <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-block-library-provides-a-searchable-index-of-individual-blocks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg Block Library</a> offers a glimpse of that and there are many more blocks on GitHub that are not yet commercially marketed.</p>\n<p>During that December 2017 Q&amp;A, developers seemed to be excited about the Gutenberg demos they had just seen but their uneasiness was palpable in their questions. Now, eight months later, the current proliferation of Gutenberg themes and plugins demonstrates that WordPress developers are ready to embrace the new editor and build the creative extensions that Gutenberg&#8217;s creators&#8217; had always anticipated.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m really looking forward to seeing what the design and developer community can build with it and where their imaginations can take us from there,&#8221; Gutenberg technical lead Matías Ventura said when I <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/interview-with-matias-ventura-on-building-the-vision-for-gutenberg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">interviewed</a> him in June. &#8220;Core is going to supply the infrastructure and the main building blocks but it’s everything that can be built around it that’s going to be exciting, as always with WordPress.”</p>\n<p>The extension ecosystem that made WordPress a success in the first place is going to be a key influence in driving adoption for the new editor. Major players in the product market are not waiting to see how users react to the new editor before building their Gutenberg-compatible interfaces. Users may not be compelled by the writing experience, but Gutenberg&#8217;s block model will provide a better framework for site customization and a core standard for page builders that interface with WordPress. If the blocks pouring into the ecosystem right now are any indication, the plugin market surrounding Gutenberg is going to offer an exciting variety of tools for site building.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 28 Aug 2018 04:28:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg Block Library Provides a Searchable Index of Individual Blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=83507\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-block-library-provides-a-searchable-index-of-individual-blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4439:\"<p>An avalanche of blocks is pouring into the WordPress ecosystem ahead of Gutenberg&#8217;s inclusion in core.

His corresponding <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/editor-blocks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Editor Blocks theme</a> is available for free on WordPress.org with support for all the business blocks.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As a theme developer I&#8217;d been waiting for a way to build themes in a way where what you see on the backend matches what you will see on the frontend,&#8221; Cooper said. &#8220;That can be achieved to some extent using the Customizer, but it&#8217;s hard to craft more than one complex page using that method.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Cooper comes from a PHP/jQuery background and said he didn&#8217;t have a strong enough understanding of ES6, Webpack, Babel, React to create Gutenberg blocks right away. The learning curve was a little steep but after getting a handle on the basics he is now able to make small contributions to the Gutenberg project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It felt like I was hitting a brick wall every five minutes when I started,&#8221; he said. &#8220;<a href=\"https://gutenberg.courses/development/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Zac Gordon&#8217;s course</a> helped me get past that stage. The #core-editor slack channel was a big help too. Other than that I just studied the code of the core blocks and used Google. As my knowledge increased I&#8217;ve tried to reach out by submitting bug reports to other Block Libraries and making minor contributions to the Gutenberg project on Github.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress.org may be able to benefit from a centralized block library in the future, as people will be frequently searching for blocks after Gutenberg lands in core. Cooper said if WordPress.org had a library like this it might even be possible to find and install blocks from inside Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I could build a block that searches my library but it wouldn&#8217;t be able to install them as most are part of a &#8216;collection,\'&#8221; Cooper said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure if in the future the &#8216;collections&#8217; will continue to grow or people will move towards releasing individual blocks.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the meantime, the Gutenberg Block Library provides a helpful resource for early adopters. Browsing through the listings, it&#8217;s exciting to see the variety of block functionality that the community is creating. Users who fully embrace Gutenberg in WordPress 5.0 will find dozens of blocks (and perhaps hundreds by that time) available for the new editor, if they know where to look.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 27 Aug 2018 16:45:26 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"WPTavern: WPCampus 2018 Videos Are Now Available to Watch\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=83466\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wptavern.com/wpcampus-2018-videos-are-now-available-to-watch\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1710:\"<p>WPCampus 2018 was held July 12-14, 2018, at <a href=\"https://wustl.edu/\">Washington University</a> in St. Louis, Missouri.

The callout has increased the visibility of the Gutenberg project and brought necessary feedback to the development and design of the new editor.</p>\n<p>Prior to WordPress 4.9.8, Gutenberg reviews held a 2.7-star average on WordPress.org. Negative reviews continue to pour in and the average rating has slipped to 2.3 stars. Users are reporting that the new editor is too complicated, cumbersome, and that it offers an inferior writing experience. A few positive reviews are sprinkled in between, calling the editor a &#8220;necessary step forward,&#8221; and those reviewers seem hopeful that others will feel the same once they get past the learning curve. The vast majority of reviews, both positive and negative, report that Gutenberg&#8217;s interface is not yet intuitive to use.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-24-at-10.32.49-AM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The Gutenberg team&#8217;s responses to reviews have improved to be less &#8220;canned&#8221; since the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-plugin-garners-mixed-reactions-from-new-wave-of-testers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">initial reactions</a> a few days after the Gutenprompt went out. However, the team still appears to be combing the feedback for bugs with the existing interface. Overall, the team&#8217;s responses are unified in a general unwillingness to admit that there are critical flaws preventing the interface from being more well-received.</p>\n<p>Active installations of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Classic Editor</a> plugin, the official antidote for those do not wish to adopt Gutenberg when it ships in WordPress 5.0, have climbed to more than 200,000. This number is about equal to the number of sites that have Gutenberg active. The Gutenberg team does not view Classic Editor installs as an important metric for understanding Gutenberg adoption or rejection but rather see these installs as a healthy intermediary step for sites keeping the same workflow while preparing for Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>In response to recent discussion surrounding the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/classicpress-gutenberg-not-included\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ClassicPress fork of WordPress</a>, Matt Mullenweg <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/classicpress-gutenberg-not-included#comment-256813\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>, &#8220;No plans to ever have direct vote determine strategic direction in WP, but we are having a bit of a referendum in the adoption of the Gutenberg and Classic Editor plugins, people are voting with their usage. The people are deciding.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This is essentially true in that users can decide if they want to adopt Gutenberg or not, for as long as the Classic Editor is supported. The Classic Editor plugin is an option people demanded but now the reality of two different admin experiences is nearer than before. The notion of a fork, though perhaps not a serious threat to the project, makes it painfully clear what some users are willing to do in order to avoid Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>With the number of Classic Editor plugin installations on the rise, WordPress is headed towards a fractured admin experience. For some it may be a healthy transition option, but in the end, the number of Classic Editor installations indicates how many sites will be running an alternative editing experience because site owners are either not ready or not willing to adopt Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>At some point in the future, WordPress will need to unite the editing experience, either by winning these users over to Gutenberg or by discontinuing support for the Classic Editor. In the meantime, WordPress product developers will need to provide support for both editing experiences or go all in on one or the other. It has the potential to erode WordPress&#8217; momentum for a few years, especially if Gutenberg doesn&#8217;t become more intuitive.</p>\n<h3>WordPress 4.9.9 Is Expected to be a 6-8 Week Maintenance Cycle</h3>\n<p>WordPress contributors met this week to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/08/24/dev-chat-summary-august-22-2018-4-9-9-weeks-1-2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">discuss WordPress 4.9.9</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As of now there’s no specific timeline for 4.9.9,&#8221; Jeff Paul said. &#8220;That will get set once release leads are in place. However, I’d like to try and finalize leads in next week’s meeting or shortly thereafter so that we can begin 4.9.9 planning and coordination as we get into September.&#8221; Paul requested contributor submit nominations for release leads, for themselves or others, ahead of next week&#8217;s meeting.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Until we have a confirmed timeline and plan for 5.0, my assumption is that we’ll continue with our minor release cadence of ~6-8 weeks with specific focus on items needed in support of 5.0,&#8221; Paul said.</p>\n<p>During his announcement at WordCamp Europe in Belgrade, Matt Mullenweg said WordPress 5.0 could happen as early as August. It&#8217;s now looking more likely that 5.0 will drop closer to the end of the year. This gives WordPress users and developers more time to prepare their sites to be compatible with Gutenberg and ready to take advantage of the new features it offers.

Regardless, Brett captures the verve and paradoxes of the city well.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 23 Aug 2018 22:23:39 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"WPTavern: New Network Media Library Plugin Creates a Shared Library on a Multisite Network\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=83415\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:101:\"https://wptavern.com/new-network-media-library-plugin-creates-a-shared-library-on-a-multisite-network\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3950:\"<p>WordPress core committer John Blackbourn has released a new plugin called <a href=\"https://github.com/johnbillion/network-media-library\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Network Media Library</a> that provides a shared media library across all sites on a WordPress multisite network. Blackbourn is an engineer at Human Made and the plugin is one he created for a client by forking Frank Bültge and Dominik Schilling&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/bueltge/multisite-global-media\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Multisite Global Media</a> plugin.</p>\n<p>By default, the plugin uses site ID 2 for the central media library, but the site ID can be customized via a filter hook.  Access to the network-wide library is currently restricted to users who have Author level permissions with the upload_files capability on the central media site. In the plugin&#8217;s description Blackbourn said the plan for future versions is to remove the need for users to be added to the central media library.</p>\n<p>After testing it locally, I discovered what the plugin&#8217;s description meant by &#8220;transparently&#8221; uploading media to the central media site. Unlike other plugins that perform a similar function (i.e. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/network-shared-media/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Network Shared Media</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/bueltge/multisite-global-media\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Multisite Global Media</a>), there is no indication that files are part of a network-wide library. For example, Multisite Global Media adds a &#8220;Global Media&#8221; tab to the media library to indicate which files are aggregated from sites on the network. The Network Media Library plugin works in an invisible way without adding a separate tab to the media library.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-23-at-1.34.56-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Frank Bültge, co-author of the Multisite Global Media plugin, asked Blackbourn why he opted to fork the plugin instead of enhancing it. Blackbourn said the main difference is that the original plugin supports local media files and his fork does not.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This was my original plan, but the main reason for the fork is the local media support in MGM means some bugs can\'t easily be fixed, eg. the featured image problem that we chatted about. The two plugins serve different purposes, MGM supports local media files, NML doesn\'t <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f60a.png\" alt=\"😊\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />.</p>\n<p>&mdash; John Blackbourn <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f1ea-1f1fa.png\" alt=\"🇪🇺\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> (@johnbillion) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnbillion/status/1032361281741893632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 22, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Developers who implement Network Media Library on their sites should be aware that it is still under active development. It currently has built-in compatibility with the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Regenerate Thumbnails</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-user-avatars/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WP User Avatars</a> plugins. The plugin also has been confirmed to be compatible with BuddyPress, Extended CPTs, Gutenberg, Stream and User Profile Picture. Blackbourn plans to test and support many more plugins in the future, including CMB2, ACF, and assorted gallery and media management plugins.</p>\n<p>Network Media Library is MIT-licensed and <a href=\"https://github.com/johnbillion/network-media-library\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">available on GitHub</a>.

There was a shared belief that ethical journalism depends on an open web, with inclusivity as a fundamental building block to creating responsibly for the future.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sessions included topics of interest to publishers both large and small, including AMP, Gutenberg, the effect of paywalls on the open web, communication between tech and editorial teams, newsletters, performance, and many other publishing-related topics.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Given that this is the only single-vertical official WordCamp it offers a rare perspective into a limited but very serious set of issues in a space,&#8221; Pantheon Community Manager Dwayne McDaniel said in his <a href=\"https://www.mcdwayne.com/2018/08/13/wc-for-publishers-2018-chicago/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">recap post</a>. &#8220;Having the official support and legitimacy of the WordCamp name brand I think adds a weight the organizers could not achieve otherwise, a claim I am going to support with the caliber of the participants as substantial evidence.&#8221;</p>\n<p>By all accounts the event was one of the best media conferences participants had ever attended.

If your background as a WordPress user is maintaining your website with the help of a page builder like Beaver Builder, Divi Builder, Elementor, or a similar plugin, this video will acquaint you with a few advantages that Gutenberg will bring to content creation in the future.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Peshev demonstrates how Gutenberg will make it easier for users to add and arrange page content that actual websites need, such as call-to-action buttons, testimonials, headers, and columns. In the past, users have relied on page builders, page templates, widgetized areas, shortcodes, custom meta boxes, and a host of disparate ways of trying to place content in a certain arrangement on a page. All of these seem rather clunky now when compared to Gutenberg&#8217;s united interface, despite the new editor&#8217;s less than perfect implementation.</p>\n<p>This video helps users understand the problems Gutenberg aims to solve. Peshev explains that page builder tools usually have heavy, complicated code bases in order to work around the problem of adding blocks of content to a page. Gutenberg is not replacing page builders. In fact, most of them are updating to provide a better experience for users in the Gutenberg era, so agencies should be able to utilize some of the same tools they have used in the past while setting clients loose in the new editorial framework.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The video was first published on my LinkedIn feed, which is comprised of business leaders, marketing experts, freelancers &#8212; many of whom use WordPress at work or for their own businesses,&#8221; Peshev said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They are not WordPress experts by any stretch, and rarely spend the time to test the &#8216;latest cool thing.&#8217; Odds are, some may have heard of it, but 95% haven&#8217;t even seen screenshots or demos of the new editorial experience.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As a digital consultant and the CEO of DevriX, a 30+ person agency, Peshev understands the need to assure users that their traditional content editing experience will still be available if they don&#8217;t want to use Gutenberg. He has been preparing his clients who fall on both sides of the 5.0 release &#8211; either to move forward with the new editor or employ the Classic Editor to maintain the old one.</p>\n<p>&#8220;At DevriX, we&#8217;ve been testing every site we manage and maintain monthly,&#8221; Peshev said. &#8220;We want to ensure that there are no unexpected regressions or fatal errors we have to deal with last minute. That said, half of our customers can benefit by using Gutenberg &#8212; we&#8217;ve had continuous conversations with them and align the roadmap accordingly. Others, on the other hand, are purely content-driven, a traditional WYSIWYG experience, and we have the Classic Editor ready to go once Gutenberg is live.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Peshev said his agency has had to find the balance between improving the editorial experience as needed (for things like landing pages and more robust sections), versus ensuring the stability and consistency of content development for traditional editorial teams. He urges other agency owners to push forward and embrace the custom work that Gutenberg will require.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg is still in its infancy; there&#8217;s a lot of work left for us, agency owners and developers,&#8221; Peshev said. &#8220;Just as we used to build custom widgets, shortcodes, and page templates, we should build a series of Gutenblocks for every customer, prepare the corresponding templates, design the resulting front-end experience, and a lot more. Realistically, the editorial experience alone is a tiny chunk of the scope of WordPress development as a whole.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 22 Aug 2018 17:08:06 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"HeroPress: Have Faith In Yourself\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://heropress.com/?p=2607\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:111:\"https://heropress.com/have-faith-in-yourself/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=have-faith-in-yourself\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3622:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/081016-StaceyBartron-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: It may not all pan out, but I\'m along for the ride with WordPress in my backpack & I cannot wait to see where I end up.\" /><p>A couple years ago I was at Prestige Conf in Minneapolis. I noticed a young woman sitting by herself, patiently waiting for the talks to start, and thought I&#8217;d say hi. Her name was Stacey, and she was a freelance web developer and design expert. She was had recently quit her job to go freelance and this conference was part of her self-education.</p>\n<p>Our conversation brought back lots of memories of the excitement of when I first quit a good job to go freelance, but I was impressed by how much more attention to detail she&#8217;d paid than I had. I was a Bad Freelancer.</p>\n<p>A few weeks later it occurred to me that she might be willing to make the header banners for HeroPress essays. I asked, and she agreed at a price I could afford.  For a couple years now all of the banners you&#8217;ve seen on HeroPress were made by Stacey Bartron. No-one else has ever told me this, but I think the banners are pretty important to the essays and she&#8217;s done a wonderful, meaningful job.</p>\n<p>Stacey quit her job and went freelance because she had faith in her own abilities. Her skills were greater than the use to which they were being put at The Day Job. As it turns out, she was right.</p>\n<p>Check out Stacey&#8217;s very own HeroPress essay here:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/finding-wordpress-fargo/\">Finding WordPress in Fargo</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Have Faith In Yourself\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Have%20Faith%20In%20Yourself&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fhave-faith-in-yourself%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Have Faith In Yourself\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fhave-faith-in-yourself%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fhave-faith-in-yourself%2F&title=Have+Faith+In+Yourself\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Have Faith In Yourself\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/have-faith-in-yourself/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/081016-StaceyBartron-150x150.jpg&description=Have Faith In Yourself\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Have Faith In Yourself\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/have-faith-in-yourself/\" title=\"Have Faith In Yourself\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/have-faith-in-yourself/\">Have Faith In Yourself</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 22 Aug 2018 08:00:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"WPTavern: ClassicPress: Gutenberg Not Included\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=83360\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wptavern.com/classicpress-gutenberg-not-included\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5995:\"<p>Depending on how far and deep you look, there is not a lot of positive sentiment surrounding Gutenberg. For Scott Bowler, the notion of merging Gutenberg into WordPress 5.0 represents a shift so <a href=\"https://medium.com/@scott.bowler83/classicpress-a-hard-fork-of-wordpress-without-gutenberg-1eeb62dd879c\">detrimental to the project</a>, he has forked WordPress into a new project called <a href=\"https://www.classicpress.net/\">ClassicPress</a>.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;The team at WordPress have decided to force Gutenberg into v5 of WordPress despite <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/gutenberg/reviews/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">massive push back by the WordPress community,</a>&#8221; Bowler said.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;I’m in the &#8216;push back&#8217; camp. After my feedback on Gutenberg fell on deaf ears I realized that WordPress is no longer a community led project — major decisions are being made by an elite few.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Sadly, I decided it was time to move to a fork that doesn’t have Gutenberg as part of the core code. A quick search revealed nobody had taken the initiative so I decided to stop complaining and take action.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>In addition to ClassicPress, Bowler has <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/petition-to-wordpress-no-gutenberg-in-wordpress-core\">filed a petition</a> on Change.org requesting that Gutenberg not be merged into WordPress 5.0. As of publishing, the petition has 10 out of 100 signatures.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;This petition is to ask the WordPress team to keep Gutenberg out of the core of WordPress and instead keep it as a plugin for users to install,&#8221; Bowler said. &#8220;In addition, this petition asks that Gutenberg does not get integrated into the core until the community agrees that the time is right.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Bowler is not the only one who feels this way. Matt Cromwell, Head of Support and Community Outreach at <a href=\"https://wordimpress.com\">WordImpress</a>, suggests that Gutenberg be bundled with WordPress as a plugin similar to Aksimet. </p>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The more I think about <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Gutenberg?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Gutenberg</a> as inevitable in WP Core, the more I am concerned that Core releases don\'t come often enough to support the kind of iterative improvements Gutes will need over the longterm.</p>&mdash; Matt Cromwell <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f393.png\" alt=\"🎓\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/271d.png\" alt=\"✝\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> (@learnwithmattc) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/learnwithmattc/status/1030588894796865536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 17, 2018</a></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Shipping <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Gutenberg?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Gutenberg</a> as a default plugin like Akismet makes a lot of sense for several reasons.<br /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2714.png\" alt=\"✔\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Allows for more iterative improvements<br /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2714.png\" alt=\"✔\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Allows for quicker development<br /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2714.png\" alt=\"✔\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Gives users more freedom of choice</p>&mdash; Matt Cromwell <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f393.png\" alt=\"🎓\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/271d.png\" alt=\"✝\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> (@learnwithmattc) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/learnwithmattc/status/1030588896281653249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 17, 2018</a></blockquote>\n\n\n<p>If Gutenberg ships with WordPress 5.0, Bowler says he is committed to maintaining compatibility with the WordPress ecosystem, keeping the project up to date with security fixes, and letting the community dictate its development.</p>\n\n<p>ClassicPress is based on WordPress 4.9.8 and is not available to the public yet. It&#8217;s in a consultation phase that interested users can participate in through the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassicPress\">ClassicPress subreddit</a>. <br /></p>\n\n<h2>Forks Are a Good Thing, But This One Doesn&#8217;t Make Sense</h2>\n\n<p>I used to think that forking WordPress is the equivalent of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_option\">nuclear option</a>, but <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Y6HcQcQWXU\">a presentation</a> by John James Jacoby in 2016 during WordSesh changed my perspective.</p>\n\n<p>Forking is a good thing as it allows people to take a project in their own direction. It opens the door for experimentation. If there are any lessons learned or improvements made, those can usually be pushed upstream to the main project.</p>\n\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\">solutions available</a> that allow users and site managers to keep the classic editor in place until a transition can be made. There&#8217;s also a Classic Editor block within Gutenberg that provides a similar user experience to the Classic Editor. </p>\n\n<p>With options available to not use or at least delay Gutenberg from becoming the new editor, and that&#8217;s <strong>if</strong> it&#8217;s merged into WordPress 5.0, ClassicPress isn&#8217;t so much of a necessary fork but rather, a last ditch effort to raise awareness to not merge Gutenberg into core. And that&#8217;s an unfortunate reason to fork WordPress. </p>\n\n<p>*<strong>Updated 8/21/2018</strong>* First paragraph was edited to &#8220;For Scott Bowler, the notion of merging Gutenberg into WordPress 5.0 represents a shift so <a href=\"https://medium.com/@scott.bowler83/classicpress-a-hard-fork-of-wordpress-without-gutenberg-1eeb62dd879c\">detrimental to the project</a>, he has forked WordPress into a new project called <a href=\"https://www.classicpress.net/\">ClassicPress</a>.&#8221; </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 22 Aug 2018 01:40:53 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"WPTavern: Drupal.org Migrates Developer Tools to GitLab\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=83338\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"https://wptavern.com/drupal-org-migrates-developer-tools-to-gitlab\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4323:\"<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-21-at-12.36.38-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>image credit: Drupal Association\n<p>The Drupal Association announced this week that Drupal.org will be <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/drupalorg/blog/developer-tools-initiative-part-5-gitlab-partnership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">migrating its developer tools to GitLab</a>. In selecting a partner for modernizing the project&#8217;s tooling, the association aimed to preserve the most valuable parts of Drupal&#8217;s workflow. They also wanted a partner that would keep evolving its code collaboration featureset.</p>\n<p>In December 2017, after evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, it appeared the association would be moving forward with Bitbucket. If the comments on that <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/drupalorg/blog/developer-tools-initiative-part-2-comparing-our-options\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">discussion</a> are any indication, the Drupal community was not excited about the selection. GitLab reached out to comment on the status of some of the blockers the association had identified and worked privately with Drupal representatives to resolve those issues.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They have escalated the internal priority of issues that blocked our adoption of GitLab, offered technical and financial support for the migration, and made a commitment to ongoing support for the Drupal project,&#8221; Drupal Association&#8217;s director of engineering Tim Hestenes Lehnen said. The team plans to migrate Drupal.org&#8217;s 45,000 projects to GitLab over the coming months.</p>\n<p>&#8220;By adding merge requests, contributing to Drupal will become much more familiar to the broad audience of open source contributors who learned their skills in the post-patch era,&#8221; Lehnen said. &#8220;By adding inline editing and web-based code review, it will be much easier to make quick contributions. This not only lowers the barrier to contribution for people new to our community, it also saves significant effort for our existing community members, as they&#8217;ll no longer need to clone work locally and generate patches.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to see how the WordPress project might also benefit from collaborating on a platform like GitLab. In October 2017, after the company <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gitlab-raises-20-million-series-c-round-adds-matt-mullenweg-to-board-of-directors\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announced a $20 million Series C round of funding</a> and appointed Matt Mullenweg to its board of directors, WordPress contributors speculated about whether the project would move to GitLab.</p>\n<p>“It’s definitely something on our minds,&#8221; Mullenweg said when asked if GitLab and WordPress might collaborate in the future. &#8220;Core WordPress is still Trac and Subversion, so I think that it’s not our top priority this year, but in the future it’s definitely on the radar.”</p>\n<p>In 2016, GitLab worked to establish itself as the most welcoming platform for open source organizations after GitHub  <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gitlab-courts-open-source-project-maintainers-with-response-to-dear-github-letter\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">failed to address open source maintainers&#8217; concerns</a> in a timely way. The company began actively courting disgruntled GitHub users following <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gitlab-courts-disgruntled-github-customers-with-response-to-recent-pricing-hike\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub&#8217;s May 2016 pricing hike</a>.</p>\n<p>GitLab&#8217;s efforts to resolve critical issues for Drupal.org demonstrates the company&#8217;s commitment to ensure open source projects have what they need. Drupal.org&#8217;s transparency throughout the decision to migrate its developer tools enabled the project to respond to the community&#8217;s request to make GitLab work. It also prompted GitLab representatives to reach out with more information on the project&#8217;s blockers. As WordPress will be looking to move its developer tools to a new platform in the future, following along with Drupal.org&#8217;s migration experience as it progresses should be a good learning opportunity.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 21 Aug 2018 22:25:32 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"Matt: Distributed Office Politics\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=48317\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"https://ma.tt/2018/08/distributed-office-politics/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:578:\"<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/18/distributed-teams-are-rewriting-the-rules-of-officeless-politics/\">This week I spoke with TechCrunch</a> about one facet of distributed work that differs from physical offices &#8212; the idea of &#8220;office politics.&#8221; I can&#8217;t claim that distributed work will solve everyone&#8217;s personal differences, but I do think it relieves some of the pressures that might come from forced cohabitation and environments that are prone to interruption.

Although you may not be able to tell from the frontend, behind the scenes the new block-based editor is powering the layout with custom blocks, allowing the Mimimi team to easily update various sections of their website.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.luehrsen-heinrich.de/\">Luehrsen Heinrich</a>, a local ad agency, built the site with a custom theme and seven blocks tailored to support the Mimimi team&#8217;s editing requirements.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The general task was to create an elegant website that is very easy and fast to maintain and that will maybe later get a blog/news section,&#8221; Hendrik Luehrsen, CEO of Luehrsen Heinrich, said. &#8220;We knew our client has some amazingly creative and tech savvy people who trusted us. That made us confident to go into Gutenberg.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The site uses a background block that enables editors to create different background patterns and wavy separators. Luehrsen said it works with ‘InnerBlocks’, similar to columns, so it can host any other block.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Bildschirmfoto-2018-08-19-um-00.37.07.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The site also has a custom Discord block that dynamically fetches some settings to display a set of users from Discord, which Mimimi uses for internal communication. The block displays an updated team roster. Social media and game blocks enable editors to easily update text and images with the layout already set.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Bildschirmfoto-2018-08-19-um-00.38.55-e1534729837643.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;I am pretty sure we could do the same layout to about 80% by combining columns, paragraphs, and images, but we didn’t want our client to fiddle around like in MS Word when you try to place an image,&#8221; Luehrsen said. &#8220;So creating a simple layout block was a logical thing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mimimi&#8217;s website also uses a custom Mailchimp signup block and a custom spacer block that offers more flexibility and responsive breakpoints.</p>\n<p>&#8220;All in all we (and our clients) are very happy with the result,&#8221; Luehrsen said. &#8220;We can see the future of WordPress ahead with this block based editor. But there is still a very long way to go until we really have nothing to smooth out anymore. There are certain things, that still require a lot of work.&#8221;</p>\n<p>From a development perspective, Luehrsen said his team still struggles with the backend styles for the editor and that frontend and backend styles differ wildly because of that. They also haven&#8217;t yet found a maintainable, stable way of applying global styles to the Gutenberg editor. Other than those outstanding issues, the agency has enjoyed building for the new editor and has another Gutenberg-page product launching soon for a different set of clients.</p>\n<h3>Mimimi Games&#8217; Gutenberg Experience: Editors Appreciate the Block Concept but Still Encounter Usability Issues</h3>\n<p>Johannes Roth, CEO of Mimimi Games, said his team has used WordPress in the past and sees Gutenberg as a major improvement for editing content.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I absolutely love it, honestly!&#8221; Roth said. &#8220;It&#8217;s so much easier to understand the setup of the page and to customize it. If the Gutenberg editor gets a few user experience improvements, I definitely see it being the new state of the art for maintaining pages. But knowing that it&#8217;s still not officially released, it has been super robust and easy to understand from my point of view.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Roth said his team appreciates the block setup, the ability to reorganize content, having small chunks of content to work on, and having custom tailored options per block.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are fewer distractions with weird toolbars and the focus is on content,&#8221; Roth said. &#8220;It also more closely resembles how we should think about splitting the formatting and decoration part from the content, as well as setting up proper pages for SEO friendliness.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Roth identified two things that the Mimimi team misses from the previous editor:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pressing tab to indent bullet lists and shift tab to reverse</li>\n<li>Using ctrl+a to quickly select all text inside a block (it sometimes selects the whole page, which doesn&#8217;t help).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;The biggest issue with usability so far has been the combination of blocks and columns, which sometimes makes it really hard to hit the &#8216;&#8230;&#8217; icon because the mouseover zones get stacked,&#8221; Roth said.</p>\n<h3>Enabling Storytellers on the Modern Web: Why Luehrsen Heinrich Took the Leap into Gutenberg Development as an Agency</h3>\n<p>Luehrsen said his agency decided to board the Gutenberg train last year at WordCamp Europe, after ditching their own ideas for creating a new page builder.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One or two months before WCEU in Paris, we were sitting on a concept and an alpha version of our own page builder system that was frighteningly similar to the block based approach,&#8221; Luehrsen said. &#8220;That Q&amp;A by Matt made us quickly realize that our project was already obsolete. We were lucky that we went pretty quickly through the five stages of grief (<a href=\"https://www.wp-munich.com/wordpress/gutenberg-structured-data/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this post</a> on structured data must have been “bargaining”). We reordered our priorities and started working with and on Gutenberg in the end of October or November of 2017.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Luehrsen Heinrich is a small agency of just four people who are all involved with Gutenberg in different ways. Luehrsen is an active contributor on the project, submitting <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/4118\">his first PR</a> over the Christmas holidays. The team also has a developer who knows block creation inside and out, a designer who designs the UX and style of their blocks, and a project manager who works with the clients on their Gutenberg editing requirements.</p>\n<p>Luehrsen said being a Gutenberg contributor helped immensely with learning block creation, despite having no prior experience with React and ES6.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Working with Gutenberg, contributing to the project and getting immediate feedback from the amazing Gutenberg team, helped us a lot in bootstrapping our process,&#8221; Luehrsen said. &#8220;Our current block creation process builds heavily on the work Gary, Adam, Matias, and all the others have done, maybe with the exception that we are using LESS internally, and not SCSS. But from folder structure, to the build process, to the structuring of the file, we try to follow the Gutenberg repo style as closely as possible, as that makes debugging and finding issues very easy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After successfully making the jump to build Mimimi Games&#8217; new Gutenberg-powered website, Luehrsen&#8217;s team is on board for building more client sites with the new editor. He sees it as a way to deliver a better user experience at a better value for the client.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our clients share our belief that storytelling in the modern web is much more than just writing text,&#8221; Luehrsen said. &#8220;TinyMCE as a &#8216;Rich Text&#8217; editor did an amazing job, but still, combining different types of media to a coherent story was a mess with metaboxes, shortcodes, and sometimes for teasers you even had to leave the edit screen. Gutenberg combines all of this in a nice, unobtrusive way. And, as always: If you can get to a good result in a faster way, that time saved is what the client is essentially buying.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 20 Aug 2018 18:54:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"Matt: Light Heretofore Unknown\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=48313\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"https://ma.tt/2018/08/light-heretofore-unkown/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:567:\"<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Yes, it is a press, certainly, but a press from which shall soon flow in inexhaustible streams the most abundant and most marvelous liquor that has ever flowed to relieve the thirst of man!

In that time, there have been sixteen releases. The more I use Gutenberg, the more nuances I encounter.</p>\n\n<h3>Disruptive Writing Flow</h3>\n\n<p>When writing a post, I press the enter key at the end of a paragraph. This creates a new paragraph block automatically. Sometimes however, I want the next block to be an Image block. The paragraph block does not have an option to be converted into another block.</p>\n\n<img />No Option to Convert to Another Block\n\n<p>I end up having to remove the paragraph block, look for the add block icon, and add the image block. This process of rearranging blocks disrupts the flow of writing. </p>\n\n<p>There are a few ways to get around this issue. The first is to not press enter at the end of a paragraph so I can add the block that I want. </p>\n\n<p>The second is to type /image inside the paragraph block which will automatically convert it to an image block. This is convenient but it&#8217;s a power user shortcut that&#8217;s difficult to discover without someone telling you about it. It&#8217;s weird that using a shortcut can convert a paragraph block to an image block but the user interface option to convert it doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>\n\n<h3>Icons Not Associated With a Block Floating in Empty Space<br /></h3>\n\n<p>In the image below is a CloudUp embed block that has a video and below it are three icons. I sometimes think these icons are related to the block above it but instead, these icons are part of the add block placeholder UI. </p>\n\n<img />Block Icons Look Like They&#8217;re For Another Block\n\n<p>Granted, a list, image, and quote icon has nothing to do with embedding videos. At-a-glance, seeing these icons can lead to a bit of confusion. I don&#8217;t want to see those icons floating in empty space when I&#8217;m working on a block they&#8217;re not attached too. <br /></p>\n\n<h3>Losing Content Due to Autosave Disconnecting<br /></h3>\n\n<p>While writing a post working remotely, I noticed the Autosave button in Gutenberg was continuously flashing. I&#8217;ve experienced something similar in the classic editor and suspected that a connection issue must have happened although I was browsing the internet without a problem.</p>\n\n<p>I finished writing the post, added meta data, and a featured image. I copied all of the content on the post, refreshed the page, and confirmed I wanted to leave the page. It turns out, my suspicion was right. </p>\n\n<p>At some point, the autosave process stopped working and I lost half the post, including the meta data. I was able to paste the lost content into the editor and go about my day. </p>\n\n<p>The current editor has fail-safes in place to prevent the loss of content, such as using a browser&#8217;s local storage. I&#8217;m unsure if Gutenberg has the same fail-safes in place. So far, this has been the only time where I&#8217;ve lost content in Gutenberg due to autosave not working correctly. </p>\n\n<h3>Digging Through the Junk Drawer</h3>\n\n<p>In the classic editor, the tool bar stays in constant view. In Gutenberg, there are multiple areas on the screen where UI elements appear and disappear depending on where the cursor is. </p>\n\n<p>If you want to see the code version of the editor, you need to click the ellipsis on the top right corner and select it from a drop-down menu. To add a new block, you have to click the + symbol and either search or select from a menu. </p>\n\n<p>The combination of visiting different parts of the editor, browsing through menus, and selecting from multiple things sometimes feels like I&#8217;m going through the junk drawer in the kitchen looking for a utensil. This feeling occurs multiple times depending on the length of a post. </p>\n\n<h3>There&#8217;s Still a Ways to Go</h3>\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been able to get used to the block concept and actually prefer it over the classic editor. However, there are certain tasks that are easier and faster to accomplish in the classic editor versus Gutenberg. </p>\n\n<p>For example, if you want to create a heading using existing text in Gutenberg, you have to select the text, click the Paragraph icon, select the heading block, and choose which heading you want. In the Classic editor, you select the text, click the preferred heading from an always visible drop-down menu and continue writing. </p>\n\n<p>These nuances to the writing flow, the user interface, and the experience of looking around for things is where I believe Gutenberg needs the most improvement. The bar has been set by the Classic editor but it has more than 10 years of iteration behind it. Hopefully, Gutenberg can reach or exceed that bar before it&#8217;s merged into core. <br /></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 17 Aug 2018 22:32:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 3.6 Adds New Icons for All Core Blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=83242\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-3-6-adds-new-icons-for-all-core-blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5014:\"<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/08/17/whats-new-in-gutenberg-17th-august/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg 3.6</a> was released today, featuring a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/8916\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">design overhaul for the core icons</a> in the block inserter. The blocks now use <a href=\"https://material.io/tools/icons/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Material icons</a>, which offer more options than the Dashicons. This update also improves the icons for the core embeds, which now display the corresponding icon for each embed service.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg testers <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/3736\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">logged an issue</a> regarding the limitations of Dashicons last year, citing the small number available, the inadequacy of their size, and the generic substitutions for embed service icons. The Gutenberg team <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/3736#issuecomment-355267596\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">closed the ticket</a>, saying there was no sign in testing that showed the icons to be a problem and that potential contributors would need to &#8220;revisit with evidence&#8221; if they wanted to re-open the issue.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not clear whether the team received the evidence or testing required to make this change but the icons become problematic in other ways. As the community started extending Gutenberg, block icon duplication became a problem, due to the limited number of Dashicons available.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We really need block icons to move away from using dashicons as soon as possible,&#8221; Gutenberg technical lead Matías Ventura said in another discussion on a proposed solution. &#8220;We are already seeing plugins adding blocks where the icon overlap is very high just because of the limited icons set, which reduces clarity for users very drastically.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/8719\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Switching to Material icons</a> solves this problem, ensuring there are unique icons for each block. The inserter design has also been updated as part of this overhaul. Previously, icons appeared with a grey background, as seen below:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-17-at-12.51.51-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The old design suddenly looks rather dated in comparison to Gutenberg&#8217;s 3.6 update, which allows for more whitespace around the icons:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-17-at-12.53.39-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The new embed icons are also greatly improved from previous versions of the plugin:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-17-at-4.09.01-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;The new icons aim to encourage people creating their own blocks to supply their own SVG,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;The hope is to make sure we can avoid multiple cases of duplicated icons diminishing the overall ability to quickly scan blocks.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ventura said Gutenberg will retain the ability to specify a Dashicon slug in the Block API but he encourages developers to &#8220;supply custom SVGs (or draw from the material icon pool) as much as possible.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gutenberg 3.6 also <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/8279\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">adds several new keyboard shortcuts</a>, including inserting a new block before/after the current block, toggling the inspector settings, removing a block, and displaying a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/8316\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">new modal help menu</a>. The modal can be launched from the Settings button at the top of the editor and users can scroll through all available shortcuts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-17-at-4.16.53-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This release also fixes many bugs that users have reported. Gutenberg will now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/8446\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">open a new preview window</a> if the prior window has been closed. It will also <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/9015\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">bring the preview tab to the front</a> when clicking the preview button. Version 3.6 <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/9010\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fixes several usability issues</a> that testers found with the permalink UI.

In the past a file had to be placed in the &#8220;WP Super Cache plugins directory&#8221; so that it would be loaded correctly but in this release I&#8217;ve added new actions that will allow you to load code from other directories too.</p>\n\n<p>Use the <strong>wpsc_add_plugin</strong> action to add your plugin to a list loaded by WP Super Cache. Use it like this:<br /></p>\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">do_action( \'wpsc_add_plugin\', WP_PLUGIN_DIR . \'/wpsc.php\' )</pre>\n\n<p>You can give it the full path, with or without ABSPATH. Use it after &#8220;init&#8221;. It only needs to be called once, but duplicates will not be stored.</p>\n\n<p>In a similar fashion, use <strong>wpsc_delete_plugin</strong> to remove a plugin.</p>\n\n<p>The release also makes it much simpler to modify the cookies used by WP Super Cache to identify &#8220;known users&#8221;. This is useful to identify particular types of pages such as translated pages that should only be shown to certain users. For example, visitors who have the English cookie will be shown cached pages in English. The German cookie will fetch German cached pages. The action <strong>wpsc_add_cookie</strong> makes this possible.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">do_action( \'wpsc_add_cookie\', \'language\' );</pre>\n\n<p>Execute that in your plugin and WP Super Cache will watch out for the language cookie. The plugin will use the cookie name <em>and</em> value in determining what cached page to display. So &#8220;language = irish&#8221; will show a different page to &#8220;language = french&#8221;.</p>\n\n<p>Use <strong>wpsc_delete_cookie</strong> to remove a cookie. Cache files won&#8217;t be deleted. It&#8217;s doubtful they&#8217;d be served however because of the hashed key used to name the filenames.<br /></p>\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">do_action( \'wpsc_delete_cookie\', \'language\' );</pre>\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re going to use either of the plugin or cookie actions here I recommend using <strong>Simple Caching</strong>. While the plugin will attempt to update mod_rewrite rules, it is much simpler to have PHP serve the files. Apart from that, any plugins loaded by WP Super Cache will be completely skipped if Expert mode is enabled.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Related Posts</strong><ul><li> <a href=\"https://odd.blog/2008/10/24/wp-super-cache-084-the-garbage-collector/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: WP Super Cache 0.8.4, the garbage collector\">WP Super Cache 0.8.4, the garbage collector</a></li><li> <a href=\"https://odd.blog/2009/01/09/wp-super-cache-087/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: WP Super Cache 0.8.7\">WP Super Cache 0.8.7</a></li><li> <a href=\"https://odd.blog/2010/02/08/wp-super-cache-099/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: WP Super Cache 0.9.9\">WP Super Cache 0.9.9</a></li></ul></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://odd.blog/2018/08/17/wp-super-cache-1-6-3/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 17 Aug 2018 16:36:51 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Donncha\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"WPTavern: WordPress for iOS 10.6 Adds A Detailed Site Activity Log\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=83231\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-for-ios-10-6-adds-a-detailed-site-activity-log\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3569:\"<p>In the past few months, the <a href=\"https://apps.wordpress.com/mobile/\">WordPress mobile application</a> for iOS has quietly received a steady round of improvements. Version 10.5 increased its compatibility with Gutenberg. <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-for-ios-and-gutenberg-dont-get-along\">Earlier this year</a>, Gutenberg and the iOS app didn&#8217;t get along particularly well. </p>\n\n<p>About a month ago in 10.4, an activity log was added that allows users to see a detailed list of activities on their sites. In 10.6, the most recent version, the activity log is now available for free WordPress.com sites and those connected with Jetpack.</p>\n\n<img />WordPress for iOS Activity Log\n\n<p>As you can see in the screenshot above, comment activity, post and page activity, and generally all site activity shows up in the log. </p>\n\n<p>Selecting an activity displays detailed information such as who performed the action, their role, IP address, and other information depending on the activity. The log displays the last 20 activities performed on the site.</p>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s unclear exactly what data the activity log monitors, where or if it&#8217;s saved, how it&#8217;s generated, and how users can turn it off. Browsing around the mobile app, I was unable to find a way to disable the activity log.</p>\n\n<h2>The WordPress Mobile Team is Quiet But Busy</h2>\n\n<p>If it weren&#8217;t for the change logs on the iTunes Store, it would be difficult for users to know what&#8217;s going on with the app. The project&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-iOS\">GitHub page</a> is buzzing with activity, but more public facing means of communication are not. <br /></p>\n\n<p>The WordPress for iOS app <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wordpressios?lang=en\">Twitter account</a> has been dormant since May. The <a href=\"https://apps.wordpress.com/blog/\">WordPress Mobile apps blog</a> hasn&#8217;t published a new post since 2016 and some of the posts that highlight new features are on the official <a href=\"https://en.blog.wordpress.com/\">WordPress.com blog</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, not every release requires a full-featured post, but the activity log is a feature that I think warrants one. An explanation of why it was created, how it works, and how users not interested in it can disable it. </p>\n\n<p>The WordPress for iOS app is <a href=\"https://apps.wordpress.com/contribute/\">open source</a> and available for free from the <a href=\"https://search.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZContentLink.woa/wa/link?mt=8&path=apps%2fWordPress\">Apple iTunes App Store</a>. You can also find links to the Android and Desktop apps on the <a href=\"https://apps.wordpress.com/\">WordPress.com Apps site</a>. </p>\n\n<h2>*Update*</h2>\n\n<p>After this article was published, I was given a <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/activity-log/\">link to a support document</a> on the Jetpack website that explains the activity log feature in more detail. The document <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/activity-log/#data-retention\">links to a list of activities</a> along with their retention periods which vary based on the plan attached to the user&#8217;s WordPress.com account. </p>\n\n<p>Only the most recent 1,000 events are displayed in the log. As noted at the end of the article, once the retention period ends for activity data, it&#8217;s moved to long-term storage where it is retained indefinitely. Data held in long-term storage is removed from the activity log.</p>\n\n<p>According to the document, there is no way to deactivate this feature. <br /></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 16 Aug 2018 22:12:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:125:\"WPTavern: WordPress.com Boots Sandy Hook Conspiracy Theory Sites, Bans Malicious Publication of Unauthorized Images of Minors\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=83171\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:135:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-boots-sandy-hook-conspiracy-theory-sites-bans-malicious-publication-of-unauthorized-images-of-minors\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13585:\"<p>WordPress.com came under fire this week for hosting a site with conspiracy theories claiming the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a hoax. The New York Times published an article titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/13/business/media/sandy-hook-conspiracies-leonard-pozner.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">This Company Keeps Lies About Sandy Hook on the Web</a>,&#8221; setting off a hailstorm of angry posts on social media that demanded Automattic take action.</p>\n<p>“Posting conspiracy theories or untrue content is not banned from WordPress.com, and unfortunately this is one of those situations,” Automattic told the New York Times in a statement. “It is a truly awful situation, and we are sympathetic to the Pozner family.”</p>\n<p>Leonard Pozner, father of Sandy Hook Elementary shooting victim Noah Pozner, claims that images of his son were being misused on a WordPress.com-hosted site where the author denied the tragedy and called his son a crisis actor. He filed copyright infringement claims on the images used on the conspiracy site in an attempt to get the content removed.</p>\n<p>Automattic examined the images and determined that there was nothing illegal about their use on the site. The company sent Pozner a reply that said, &#8220;because we believe this to be fair use of the material, we will not be removing it at this time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the New York Times article, Automattic admits its insensitivity in handling the situation, apologizing to the family, but said the posts in question &#8220;are not violating any current user guidelines, or copyright law.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The pain that the family has suffered is very real and if tied to the contents of sites we host, we want to have policies to address that,&#8221; Automattic told the New York Times.</p>\n<h3>WordPress.com Updates it Privacy Policy, Banning Malicious Publication of Unauthorized, Identifying Images of Minors</h3>\n<p>After consulting with the Internet Archive&#8217;s Wayback Machine, it appears WordPress.com has quietly updated its privacy policy, which now includes unauthorized images of minors on the list of things the platform considers private information. The <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180201091159/https://en.support.wordpress.com/private-information/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">previous policy</a> appears below:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-16-at-8.29.14-AM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.support.wordpress.com/private-information/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">updated policy</a> adds &#8220;the malicious publication of unauthorized, identifying images of minors&#8221; to that list.</p>\n<p>Searching Twitter for discussion surrounding Sandy Hook conspiracy sites turns up a slew of tweets calling on people to boycott WordPress.com and other Automattic products. However, there are also responses on the other end of the spectrum, with Sandy Hook conspiracy theorist supporters retweeting a user who claims that WordPress.com has shut down his site.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Minutes ago this morning, I discovered that WordPress has unilaterally and without warning shut down Fellowship of the Minds for alleged violations of \"Terms of Service\".

These events are outlined in <a href=\"http://memoryholeblog.org/2018/08/14/wordpress-automattic-shuts-down-fellowshipoftheminds/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a post on memoryholeblog.org</a>, a site maintained by James F. Tracy, a former professor of journalism and media who became known for his research questioning the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre and Boston Marathon bombing. Tracy&#8217;s blog was also removed from WordPress.com in 2016 for violation of Automattic’s Terms of Service.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-16-at-8.48.40-AM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Automattic did not detail specific infractions in either case of removal. It&#8217;s not clear whether the site referenced in the New York Times article was removed for a new offense or a previous one. The removals seem to have coincided with WordPress.com&#8217;s updated privacy policy, but Automattic&#8217;s PR department has not responded to a request for comment on the matter.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As with Automattic’s treatment of MHB, FOTM’s disappearance strongly suggests how WordPress.com’s policies are being tailored to placate outside parties whose foremost interest is in stifling political speech on potential high crimes, and how in this instance such poorly-founded grounds for censorship have triumphed over free speech,&#8221; Tracy said.</p>\n<p>Historically, Automattic has been a stalwart defender of free speech on the web. It&#8217;s outlined as part of the <a href=\"https://en.support.wordpress.com/user-guidelines/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.com&#8217;s User Guidelines</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>WordPress.com strongly believes in freedom of speech. We have a vast audience spread across many cultures, countries and backgrounds with varying values and our service is designed to let users freely express any ideas and opinions without us censoring or endorsing them.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s not clear whether Automattic changed its policy in response to this situation or whether this situation revealed holes in it that the company wanted to improve. In either case, the policy change seems to have enabled Automattic to do what outraged onlookers wanted them to do, except outside of the emotional mandate issued by the New York Times.</p>\n<p>Without the new privacy policy in place, removal of a site based on offensive material constitutes censorship. Automattic had already determined that the post using the child&#8217;s image, while distasteful and offensive, was fair use for the material. The image had likely already been used thousands of times by news organizations with a different narrative attached to it that is more in alignment with the majority&#8217;s view of the tragedy.</p>\n<p>As it is a private company, Automattic&#8217;s terms of service do not have to reflect the full freedom of speech allowed by the law. However, the company has always upheld its reputation in the past as an uncompromising defender of its users when presented with requests for censorship.</p>\n<p>In a recent <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180206/10271639166/why-allegedly-defamatory-content-wordpresscom-doesnt-come-down-without-court-order.shtml\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">post on Techdirt</a>, Automattic general counsel Paul Sieminski and Holly Hogan detail how WordPress.com handles its role in managing intermediary liability when the company receives complaints regarding defamatory content:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Making online hosts and other intermediaries like WordPress.com liable for the allegedly defamatory content posted by users is often criticized for burdening hosts and stifling innovation. But intermediary liability isn&#8217;t just bad for online hosts. It&#8217;s also terrible for online speech. The looming possibility of writing a large check incentivizes hosts like Automattic to do one thing when we first receive a complaint about content: Remove it. That decision may legally protect the host, but it doesn&#8217;t protect users or their online speech.</p></blockquote>\n<p>That article explains the level of nuance involved in handling complaints and the costs associated with protecting its users&#8217; freedom of speech. Automattic&#8217;s counsel concludes with an observation that &#8220;leaving such important decisions to the discretion of Internet hosts is misplaced and tilts the balance in favor of silencing often legitimate voices.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WordPress.com is a Host for Websites, Not a Social Media Silo</h3>\n<p>WordPress.com&#8217;s platform is distinct from social networks in that it is not a social media silo. It acts more as a host and cannot have one-off shutdowns of sites anytime there is a public outcry.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordPress.com is much closer to being a common carrier than Facebook and other social media,&#8221; Dan Kennedy, associate professor at Northeastern University&#8217;s school of Journalism, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dankennedy_nu/status/1029343514243616769\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> in response to the NYT article. &#8220;That difference really doesn’t get highlighted here.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Self-hosted WordPress (.org) user and data journalist Matt Stiles also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stiles/status/1029220655013609472\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">commented on the distinction</a>, and followed up with me privately, identifying WordPress.com as &#8220;a free-speech sidewalk for the Internet.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordPress.com needs to make clear to the public that it&#8217;s a host, not a place that controls &#8212; through algorithms or other curation, and revenue — content,&#8221; Stiles said. &#8220;I am NOT a supporter of sites like this. I just want WordPress to thrive as an open-source tool and as an important paid host for web sites. I&#8217;m also worried about WordPress.com having to make arbitrary decisions about content. It&#8217;s tough to define hate speech. We know it when we see it, but I worry about censorship on private platforms.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Dave Winer also <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/08/16/132055.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">commented</a> that the article failed to capture the distinction of WordPress.com as a host for websites:</p>\n<blockquote><p>WordPress.com isn&#8217;t like the others, it isn&#8217;t a silo, so banning him from that service will not necessarily have any affect on the presence of his site. He will be able to export his site, set up his own server, point the DNS entry at that server, and proceed on the open web and it will appear to outside viewers as if nothing happened. This will be the end of the discussion, unless the anti-speech advocates try to exert pressure on the open web. There they will find there is no CEO, no corporate headquarters, no shareholders afraid of losing value, none of the usual pressure points.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This particular situation regarding the Sandy Hook conspiracy site seems to have hit a nerve due to the fact that there are children involved. Despite WordPress.com&#8217;s quick privacy policy change in this instance, Automattic is still a rare outlier among publishing companies when it comes to support of free speech on the web. Media outlets and tech companies are increasingly clamoring for offensive content to be removed, instead of taking a principled stand against censorship.</p>\n<p>Today <a href=\"https://www.poynter.org/news/200-newspapers-will-write-pro-journalism-editorials-will-they-also-listen\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">more than 200 newspapers</a>, including the New York Times, are coordinating to publish editorials calling out President Trump&#8217;s characterization of the press as the &#8220;enemy of the people.&#8221; Corporate-owned news media is ready to decry attacks on free speech, but do they really believe in it when it counts? That freedom isn&#8217;t predicated on whether the speech is true or unoffensive to readers.</p>\n<p>Calling out a free speech platform like WordPress.com, without any distinction for its vital role in enabling journalists across the globe, is a coercive attempt to exact a desired result. What WordPress.com has done is groundbreaking in democratizing publishing and enabling bloggers to break news on their own sites.</p>\n<p>The New York Times raking WordPress.com over the coals for its refusal to censor its users is an egregious double standard. A publication cannot call for free speech for itself while eating up the rights of everyone else they don&#8217;t agree with. Principles aren&#8217;t principles if they only serve you when they are convenient.</p>\n<p>Forcing the censorship of offensive speech may feel like swift justice in the short term, but it weakens the fabric of a free society. Let discerning readers make up their own minds when they come across sites disseminating conspiracy theories.  Although it may be an unpopular stance, the tragic nature of this particular offense cannot bypass the principles that underpin our basic freedoms.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 16 Aug 2018 16:58:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 327 – Truth, Misinformation, and Good Ideas\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=83205&preview=true&preview_id=83205\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-327-truth-misinformation-and-good-ideas\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2980:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"http://jjj.me\">John James Jacoby</a> and I discuss what&#8217;s new in the world of WordPress.

Jeet, <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/ill-keep-looking-for-a-cms-unless-i-find-wordpress/\">Saurabh</a>, <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-my-passport-to-open-source/\">Aditya</a>, <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/growing-wordpress-india/\">Alexander</a>, and <a href=\"https://heropress.com/?s=india\">many others</a> gave deep and meaningful advice on how I, as a white American male, should approach the task I had set before me. This is one of the reasons it makes me so happy when I hear stories of how WordPress changes lives there, especially for women.</p>\n<p>This week&#8217;s HeroPress replay is from Juhi Patel, from Gujarat, in northwestern India. As I recall, hers was also the very first HeroPress essay to be multi-lingual, something I&#8217;ve always wanted.</p>\n<p>Juhi&#8217;s culture isn&#8217;t too keen on women doing Professional work, a problem not all that uncommon throughout the world. Not only did she have the courage to move against that belief system, WordPress gave her the tools to practically make it happen, and thereby be an example to other women around her. There are still good things happening in the world, and Juhi is helping to make them happen.</p>\n<p>Check out her essay here:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-good-indian-women/\">Is WordPress Good for Indian Women?</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: India and HeroPress\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=India%20and%20HeroPress&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Findia-and-heropress%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: India and HeroPress\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Findia-and-heropress%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Findia-and-heropress%2F&title=India+and+HeroPress\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: India and HeroPress\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/india-and-heropress/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/082317-150x150.jpg&description=India and HeroPress\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: India and HeroPress\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/india-and-heropress/\" title=\"India and HeroPress\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/india-and-heropress/\">India and HeroPress</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 15 Aug 2018 11:00:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:97:\"WPTavern: Yoast SEO 8.0 Introduces Gutenberg Sidebar Integration, Revamps Classic Editor Meta Box\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=83162\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"https://wptavern.com/yoast-seo-8-0-introduces-gutenberg-sidebar-integration-revamps-classic-editor-meta-box\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3396:\"<p><a href=\"https://yoast.com/yoast-seo-8-0-introducing-the-yoast-seo-gutenberg-sidebar-a-revamped-meta-box/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Yoast SEO 8.0</a>, featuring the plugin&#8217;s first pass at integrating with the Gutenberg interface.

In addition to the funding, selected companies will be able to take advantage of Awesome Motive&#8217;s media presence, network of business associates, and receive guidance.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;The problem is that the WordPress market is not very well understood by investors,&#8221; Balkhi said. &#8220;And frankly, the majority of WordPress businesses are not large enough to meet their criteria.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;But this doesn’t mean that WordPress businesses don’t have the potential. It’s quite the opposite – they have a lot of potential. There are tons of opportunities to grow in the WordPress ecosystem with the right playbook, and I want to help prove that.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Founders will be given a lot of advice although they won&#8217;t be required to act upon it. Backers of the growth fund will also maintain a hands-off approach, interfering as little as possible with day-to-day operations. </p>\n\n<p>Five companies will be hand-selected to receive funding. To be eligible for investments, WordPress-focused companies must be at least six months old. To apply, founders need to fill out the <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/news/announcing-the-wpbeginner-growth-accelerator-fund/#wpbfund\">following form</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The WPBeginner growth accelerator fund could be the jump start that gives a handful of companies the opportunity to take things to the next level. <br /></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 15 Aug 2018 00:15:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"WPTavern: Sami Keijonen’s Foxland Themes and Plugins are Now Available for Free\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=82882\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"https://wptavern.com/sami-keijonens-foxland-themes-and-plugins-are-now-available-for-free\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3674:\"<p>WordPress theme designer and developer <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/samikeijonen\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sami Keijonen</a> has made all of his theme and plugin products at Foxland <a href=\"https://foxland.fi/foxland-products-for-free/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">available for free</a>. Keijonen&#8217;s WordPress.org-hosted themes are active on more than 10,000 websites.</p>\n<p>During the past three years he began taking on more client work, which gave him less time for theme building and maintenance. Last month he accepted a front-end engineer position at 10up that is keeping him busy.</p>\n<p>Fans might remember Keijonen&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-mina-olen-free-wordpress-theme-experiment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mina Olen Free WordPress Theme Experiment</a> when he made the theme available for free on GitHub to see if potential customers would be inspired to purchase after being able to test drive the theme on their own sites. At that time he said he struggled to support his theme shop, because the business aspect of it wasn&#8217;t one of his strengths.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to get lost in all the competition in the WordPress theme industry, especially when major players have more money to drop on advertising and support staff. The days of building a beautiful theme and selling it without any kind of marketing are long gone. Prospective theme developers have to be ready to embrace the challenges of competing in a much wider market in 2018.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Foxland isn’t a gold mine,&#8221; Keijonen said in his announcement. &#8220;Foxland brings about 3,000 to 4,000 Euros per year, which is OK but my goal was 10,000 euros.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Customers appreciated Keijonen&#8217;s attention to detail, accessibility, and performance. Respected WordPress theme author <a href=\"https://tungdo.github.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tung Do</a> said Keijonen&#8217;s themes are &#8220;great examples of best practices.&#8221; Many of them also include support for popular plugins.</p>\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://foxland.fi/downloads/checathlon/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Checathlon</a>, one of his best works, is active on <a href=\"https://foxland.fi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">foxland.fi</a>. It offers built-in styles for Easy Digital Downloads (including product and account pages), Custom Content Portfolio, and Jetpack (testimonials, portfolio, and email subscription widget).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checathlon.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://foxland.fi/downloads/category/themes/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Foxland collection</a> includes several beautiful minimalist free themes with previously-pro versions that enable additional Customizer settings, page templates, and widgets. All of Keijonen&#8217;s custom <a href=\"https://foxland.fi/downloads/category/plugins/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">plugins</a> (created to accompany the themes) are also available for free.</p>\n<p>The Foxland shop has cancelled all the recurring subscriptions but will continue to support existing purchases up to a year from the purchase date. Keijonen said he will maintain most of the old themes and plugins with small updates coming in the future but plans to deprecate some as well.</p>\n<p>The landscape of WordPress theming is about to change quite a bit when Gutenberg is merged into core. Keijonen said he plans to embrace these changes by creating new free themes with Gutenberg support, built on more modern code.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 23:46:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"WPTavern: New BackYourStack Tool Drives Financial Support for Open Source Projects\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=83100\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"https://wptavern.com/new-backyourstack-tool-drives-financial-support-for-open-source-projects\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2606:\"<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-11-at-5.17.24-PM-e1534026554562.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://opencollective.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Open Collective</a> launched in 2017 as a new organization that helps groups raise funds and manage them transparently. The service is now widely used by many open source projects. Webpack, one of the first major Open Collective success stories, was able to fund its first full-time developer through the service and is now <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/webpack\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">operating on an estimated annual budget of $331,471</a>. The <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/how-the-san-francisco-wordpress-meetup-is-using-open-collective-to-fund-activities\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">San Francisco WordPress meetup</a> (WPSFO) is one example of a WordPress group that successfully uses the service to <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/wordpress-sf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">receive sponsorships</a> that help cover expenses for events.</p>\n<p>Open Collective has launched a new tool called <a href=\"https://backyourstack.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">BackYourStack</a> that helps people and organizations become aware of projects they use that need funding. The tool scans GitHub accounts (for individuals and organizations) and identifies projects that have already set up accounts on Open Collective. The tool shows all detected dependencies and the repositories where they are used.</p>\n<p>Here are a few sample results you get from scanning the WordPress GitHub account:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-13-at-11.36.42-AM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The results display where project is used, the number of full-time maintainers, progress to reach the next goal, and a few organizations that are already backing the project. Open Collective also allows backers to support multiple dependences in bulk via a lump sum as an alternative to backing each project individually.</p>\n<p>Not every open source project listed on Open Collective will have the need to fund salaries and events, but even a small yearly budget can reduce out-of-pocket costs for open source maintainers for things like hosting and promotional costs. Many widely used open source projects go without funding because users are not aware of their needs. BackYourStack helps people and organizations make a direct connection to the projects they depend on.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 17:38:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:8:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Wed, 12 Sep 2018 20:27:58 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Wed, 12 Sep 2018 20:15:28 GMT\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 1\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:4:\"gzip\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20180831202258\";}","no"),
